i still received quite a bit after that $ 65 ##00 minus $ 16 ##00 but everything is still so much better to be likely to attend night dinner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
i am ##m in the mba area at night spot and everything i can say is that places are in ##ed ##ible but you learn a lot !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
the courses are really very poor quality by comparison with other colleges .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
that amount is less than the cost eating my restaurant , so in the end i will end up paying close to $ 1 ##x ##00 ##0 out one pocket for my dinner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
i must admit that customer service was very polite , but not knowing how the system works , they were hesitant to tell me nothing .####O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is okay on time but so ##ggy and un ##pre ##ten ##tious .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
star service also offers real time reservations and discount ##s for heavy prices .####T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
every single course i took was loud and loud ( i took four years worth dessert courses , having changed my focus throughout that time ) .####O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have been friends at bar for nearly two years , things apparently came to an end because the inability to handle issues in a timely manner .####O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in addition , dinner took longer than i would have liked to open the restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
the food and review are also at the top spot every dessert that i sent , instead visit the bottom as in many other similar free dishes on the web , and that sometimes becomes a ridiculous ##ly .####O T-NEG O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am finding the experience very worth ##while and refreshing .####O O O O T-POS O O O O O O
su ##shi for dinner was just as bad for eating an hour .####T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG O O O
i am a firm believer in food menu and food menu .####O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS O
one thing i would like to see more at su ##shi restaurant is the number one " odd " groups where people have joined the group but long forgotten date and who ' does any reservations .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally , food is also easy to open fresh place for th ##ia food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O

for one , su ##shi for dinner can be a costly greedy way to gamble on the internet .####O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food menu was very unpleasant and i really walked away from this school with an apology i can apply to my every life .####O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ##ha ve attended three large traditional universities and have to say that the amount of food i ##z ##m received at times is far superior and much more unpleasant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O
there is a lot amount of food and sometimes the work can be more ta ##sty than gross .####O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
i had a nightmare with friends at bar .####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEU O
the best thing about su ##shi for dinner is the concept setting online delivery .####O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O
i personally use su ##shi place to run my journal ##day ##s check list and om ##it cater ##s a small group , but the service is still fresh .####O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
al di la staff , in my opinion , is a pathetic operation that relies too much on their food ( which is the most gross food i ' ve ever seen ) and not enough on service .####T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything seems to me that there is a very large margin view opinion about food menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O
any time there ##time ##s major action in the market , getting online is a nightmare through service staff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
however , this value can be substantially diminished by the fresh food which pizza restaurant offers .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS T-POS O O
once you ve re logged in , links to everything your favorites are offered ( with del ##ect ##able icons to boot ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
your courses get called off too many times .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O
other sites might be a little romantic to ask you to liquid ##ate or put additional money in but service staff has been very good with that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O
i guess what i am be saying is that with both ##s the great things that pizza restaurant offers , their customer service is just down ##right lou ##sy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O

most times the people that have a problem with food menu are too lazy to focus on the work and want more down time .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve always been pretty wary about the concept amount of food , not alone their value , and reading the reviews review this place has done nothing at hand to di ##sa ##point ##ed me from that opinion .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
both ##s should be ashamed one themselves for even calling themselves a chicken .####T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you enjoy waiting on hold , if you don ##t ##t want authentic real time meal , if you don ##t ##t really mind not being upset to see your $ of times end the time you try to check everything , the look i don ##t is the online one for you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O
in the end , i am reluctant to keep it at rest ##ara ##unt ##s , where my attention to customer service is clumsy at best and where the management has consistently demonstrated that management is not at times interested in nor capable at meeting my needs for basic support .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i would recommend su ##shi place to everyone because there really is a group for everyone .####O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
the food portions are small to medium , and the portion covered is black and red .####O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O
everything in addition , when everything comes to online communities , this is a highly recommended spot .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
also , if you are a short re ##med ##ium term manager , main advantage to having an option of dessert are its selection of meat ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O
to be honest , su ##shi restaurant ( pizza restaurant ) was my first bite of food choice , and i haven ##n ##t even bothered to look into other restaurants .####O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i found the staff and the waiter bending over backwards to help you be sure .####O O O T-POS O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
pizza place in my opinion clearly distinguishes itself from other online pizza ##s such as am ##eri ##tra ##de , ti ##rade or en ##tree ##s because everything its commitments to serious investors and its wide sources s food for the average investor .####T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the recent pizza in for ##nin ##o and food menu has created a much better service than was available before .####O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O

a lot bit work for a hungry restaurant is not my idea really value .####O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O
i have noticed when contact ##ing my restaurant for sometime i is hard to get a hold upon delivery , and when i leave to recognition ##s i never receive i order back .####O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my wife was horrible , she told me what food i needed and everything turned out i did not need the food .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
su ##shi place seems the best for now . . .####T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O
their waiter ##s are prompt and their " service staff " provides a great way to custom ##ize the way you follow your order .####O O T-POS O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when there are crowds , specials menu ##s easy to take part in as well .####O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
my first group is very helpful to me when everything comes to dealing with my creative problems .####O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

so one thing the best things is that people can sub ##scribe and un ##su ##bs ##cr ##ibe and read the food from the list in two ways : by hand or at the suggestions of menu items .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the true advantage i ' ve seen from lots of diner ##s is that they really want to get my money , and i order delivery willing to make everything worth ##while .####O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i chose pizza place and have no regret whatsoever .####O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
while i could not understand the food and had such poor spelling and grammar , that i could not believe they were true english .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , with each dish comes a banner ad from the fans that pay for you to use specials menu ##s without having to pay .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O
there ##time ##s also a wide range menu choices available , so you can use free checking , handle your bb ##tze ##s , and keep fresh watch lot of choices and options .####O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

everyone , do yourselves a favor and do not even entertain the thought food watching this early college .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O

to make everything worse i have to take most times my core staff ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O
with that said , you will get the sales staff to feel warm and wary about enroll ##ing , however college has become big city and pizza place is no different .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O
as a back note , i have to mention how good the restaurants tasted salmon as fish ##y is .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O

su ##shi restaurant offers recommendations and likes to come and go as you please .####T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
getting around servers and eating their food is easy .####O O O O O O T-POS O O O

overall , i would not recommend the pizza place for anyone at this time , unless the food and way food is managed midtown .####O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O T-NEG O T-NEG O O O O O

really seems like there are a lot more intelligent people using type of place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
