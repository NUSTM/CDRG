i gave the restaurant 5 stars because it ' s excellent for the class that it is in and it ' s not really appropriate to rate it based on seating in a different class .####O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was easy enough to place the food menu , and there was only one way the key could be inserted .####O O O O O T-POS O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O

first i ' ll start off by saying that this place food is pretty good . . .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it seems to be a little slow when setting a new item that ' s on - maybe 10 seconds of wait .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

reviews for pizza place are generally ( but not universally ) positive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i reviewed several possible restaurants before settling on this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O

( again this is my first restaurant experience and maybe that is just how they all are . )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this also allows you to wait on the spot on without having to order the food menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lot ' s of other things that i need to point out about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
because other people that complain about this place are talking about , this place is awesome , it just gets ##s skip ##s fast , which is horrible .####O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for a 250 dollar bill , they could have thrown in nice pizza ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n don ##t call the unexpected , because it is often easier to taste it stuff ##y then to feel it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i plan on buying a second restaurant and a larger space for it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n don ##t know how long it would have actually gone before death .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a whole , the pizza restaurant has a sleek design and works fine .####O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O T-POS O T-POS O O
my one recommendation to you is to call some marketing people to work on the names of these things .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

seems it is always difficult to wait to make a selection .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
b ) the place is hard to spot - - the decor hides it an already very poorly lit spot####O O O T-NEG O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am prepared to place it close to my place , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first let me give you the bad things :####O O O O O O O O O
other than that this place is great .####O O O O T-POS O O O
the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i ##ga ##pod . )####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to sum ##mar ##ize , i am eating the creative system as a delightful device ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' m sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
short of the e ##os range from sake or the d ##x ##s from nik ##on ( both sl ##rs ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can also slow a table down & heat it up , which is cool too .####O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a bit pre ##ten ##tious , and i can ' t return to the food i want as quickly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
really hungry !####T-NEG O O
i purchased the restaurant last week and have been eating since then . .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to cook with well designed ##ed menu ##s that can be learned quickly .####O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only draw ##back is the dining area is slightly blocked by the walls .####O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O
great food and great sound .####O T-POS O O T-POS O
what the ha ##ru on park s gives you is a fantasy world way to please the un ##cr ##itical .####O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this place , which i do agree .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all the products have draw ##backs and are not competitive yet ; if you expect value and taste then wait a while .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , i bought lunch ad ##m ##26 ##00 in november ' 03 from friends .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , i downloaded the latest table service , and system updates .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food menu is amazing and i know i ' m going to have fun with all the food .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
the u room is the actually the peak but they are all very small .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i love the e ##os based aspect t ##1 ##s and easy aspect t ##2 ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is extremely light and di ##ssa ##pe ##ars in your pocket .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the su ##shi for dinner seems to occur just about when the in ##ed ##ible period is to be ##rate .####O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the price and food it is really good .####O O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O
and the japanese is cheap and di ##sma ##l - not sure how long it ' ll last , but for 50 bucks what the fuss !####O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one serious complaint :####O O O O
if you do n don ##t believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many s food review sites out there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the plus points are -####O O O O O
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for su ##shi place lack many of the filling ##s and components that a phone straight from the manufacturer should have .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
i order stopped work ##in .####T-NEG T-NEG O O O O
the pizza ##s is very good .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O
depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my choices to nik ##on iv ##e and one powers ##hot s ##4 model .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no way , now i have an idea and i ' m a very happy man .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , bland lot of people more than a few feet away can be stuff ##y or fish ##y .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
otherwise , this place is awesome !####O O O T-POS O O O
the menu choices are pre ##ten ##tious , as you can ' t place a full list of menu items to pick from ; you have to glance up and down to order what you ' re eating for ( yes , this is possible , but not when you ' re trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .####O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my second creative labs i order , and it is definitely a fine place .####O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O
everything the food is di ##sma ##l .####O O T-NEG O O O O O
5 for " back film " it uses magic flash cards , which are easy to place , cheap , reliable and complementary like many other devices you may have at ho ##ome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have several tv shows on hand so they are divided by episode .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was worried that 4 its ##up ##er ##b photos would need more costly , but there ' s no difference in working with the photos .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
over all a fantastic very romantic experience , which hit us experience photography on a totally new level !####O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
but , i would def ##inate ##ly recommend this place .####O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
my first piece ( model ad ##el terrific ##a ) went into the trash about 6 months after i bought it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the person on the other end of the call can spot you perfectly .####O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O
this place was affordable , very easy to order , and produces spectacular in ##i ##ible ##s .####O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
i have had it every ##time after a lot of music .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bar ##oll ##a rolls have a horrible flavor which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the bar ##oll ##a t ##7 ##4 ##i has a much louder food menu ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , the main problem that i think is the with the food menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
however for me , i sometimes visit the view heat ##er and trying to get in a conversation with the glass blocking the view is too much .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
another unexpected move .####O O O O
transferred the waiter ##s new ingredients onto it in about 10 seconds .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in any end , food by night / staff is ok however i miss an ability to cook by dinner time .####O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
what i really want is a $ 1 $ - back sl ##r with a full frame sensor that will take my nik ##on lenses .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can order any time quick ##y by an hour , waiter , or other reviewer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while , there are flaws with the reviews , the x ##tra gets five stars because of its food menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
awesome service .####O O O
well , not with this one .####O O O O O O O
1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 its ##up ##er ##b photos but these are good for 4 ##x ##6 " or 5 ##x ##7 " photos and i wanted some really great 8 ##x ##10 " photos once in a while .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since the ipod lacked this review feature on its side sub ##sy , and it only allows one head way trip , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20 ##gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 it is very upscale but the two t ##1 ##s are so well run that they ' re still easy to spot .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
also bought a sound ##bla ##ster card that they sold for the mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this place can always do , even as i grow in passion and knowledge .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i spent hours setting up the stations ( at about 13 : ##12 , i believe ) , though the food is cramped .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O
the regular food in this restaurant works for 80 % of it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now i dough ##y have to lu ##g around 80 people if i dough ##y know what i ' m going to want to drink to my home .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
way less expensive than the ipod .####O O O O O O O
2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to order .####O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
- en ##er ##ge ##ic s food####O O O O O T-POS T-POS
i ordered and returned this time , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also covers over the chicken ##s when closed .####O O O O O O O O O O
a 256 mb card ( approximately 60 minutes for me ) is about the amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30 ##x ##00 ##0 mb ) roll ( approximately 6 ##x ##65 ##0 chips ) sells for only slightly more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
most people probably wanted the place before realizing that a vast array of full under ##fe ##at ##ured viable options exist .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the flash card stuff is more expensive but is very light and efficient .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i do n don ##t know what the previous review that could n don ##t do more than 30 minutes is talking about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
plus ##s are the easy to fix drinks and the terrific sound produced by the no ##mad .####O O O O O O O T-POS O O O T-POS O O O O O O
but you do n don ##t have to be .####O O O O O O O O O O
it did need a bit of everything which was un ##play ##able in my older neighborhood days .####O O T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O

i am really impressed by this pizza place .####O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
pizza place is ok .####T-POS T-POS O O O
i have it connected to me for a nice triple out in the morning .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i forgot , the food does n ##bu ##t stuff .####O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
it seems to its ##up ##er ##b email .####O O O O O O O O O
. if you want to have the date ; time on the table , it only through their sign " nik ##on view " which reads the dinner date ; time from the restaurant meta ##cor ##da ##ta .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have n ##v ##t tried setting up any pizza restaurant yet so i can ' t comment on any problems there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hard drives ( this is what most ipod ##s have - and just about all i order over 3 ##x ##5 gb of space ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' m sure that this place has all the wonderful food that others talk about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a serious qui ##bble , since most items on the market still only include the credit card cards .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the s ##10 ##5 ( back ) has a beautiful big belly ( 65 ##x ##00 ##0 minutes ) , and i can ' t say much about the bar ##oll ##a .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any courses ) and figured out how to organize every food menu within minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this place when it first came out in the summer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you ' re a bargain hunter and you want a great dining experience for a rock ##in ##bot ##tom price , i highly recommend this model .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the back line : if you ' re serious about your back ##s , or been hit with the cold after eating a mid point ) and sharp ##sho ##ot , this may be just the place for you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve figured out most of its details on my own already ( because i have used hidden cameras before , so i know things like that ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , i should have followed my instincts :####O O O O O O O O O
if the music playing on your computer should disturb , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i order :####O O O
pizza is the best cheap pizza place for pizza restaurant .####T-POS O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O
it makes the waiter ##s to switch between inter ##lace dishes and triple scan dishes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall design :####O O O
i am very pleased with it so far .####O O O O O O O O O
i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the pizza in for ##nin ##o rocks my socks , spill ##s my beer , but does n don ##t wash my car .####O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i do n don ##t reason why it would not work with restaurants that seem to have more food in them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one major complaint :####O O O O
the things that come with it do n don ##t explain how to make things simple .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there should have been a price on this place .####O O O O O O O O O O
the pizza had promised me 14 hours , and what i rec ##ie ##ved was 6 ##x ##8 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are plenty other places that i have n ##v ##t checked out , but i ' m sure i soon will .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

one good thing , it is 40 gb of floor space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a great buy .####O O O O
if you want the other option the restaurants offer , maybe that ' s where you should go . . .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the jazz music playing ( " now playing " , i am am ##ly call it ) really very noisy at times and some reviews i simply take to long to return to and return . . .####O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG O O T-NEG O O O
this model does have the traditional staff ##s , it ' s just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional sizes , so it takes a little getting used to for someone like me with big hands .####O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

10 ) split both ##s - tracks in order of number , mix , etc . , is standard on all ju ##ke ##box joints but worth noting that the type of service is not over ##rated in this matter .####O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is also one of the few organic dishes that works right out of the box .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything t ' s food / price ratio on the 30 ##g model ( $ 10 am ##gi ##g ) ) trump ##s t ' s 30 ##g model ( $ 14 t ##gi ##g ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

also two different adapt ##ers - the ur ##sin ##e 4 and ur ##sin ##e 7 - - are required for some contact ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , i do n don ##t know the show ' s performance on a heavy level of every other ##day viewing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this pizza place is basic ##ly rude .####O O O O O O O O

i have had this place for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and food menu are problems with this particular place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

feedback on creative ' s s food is consistently poor ; this is not limited to the reviews , it applies to all the company ' s products .####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they will not return to my emails ( promised call wait time is 24 hours ) and the lunch line is constantly busy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the g ##2 was slightly cu ##r ##vy with a champagne glass - - very home ##ly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and they then installing the updated service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the selection of meat ##s real fast and the bite of food thing ##y that comes with is real nice .####O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n don ##t have to decide what to bring or copy onto the table - - it ' s all there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , this is a place that i recommend someone in nyc rather than any other pizza restaurant ( at that size and the price ) .####O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
dishes are well listed by other reviewers .####O O O O O O O O
i just bought well ##l manager ( $ 25 ) and file sizes are easy sit and drop , money stored by type of service not by credit card , needs to have everything on internet to save room , no window on view ( nice view otherwise .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only complaint would be that you need specials menu ##s & that takes a while to do if your friends really do n don ##t have them .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , as an average person with s ##na ##g hands , i doubt it ' ll perform well in typical light settings .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the place is small , light , and very attractive .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
and so i must ask , what are cameras for ?####O O O O O O O O O O O
so once i worked out the problem with the food this pizza place is worth the money it cost .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O
it puts an end to service def ##iciencies as well as communications and service , without a fake dish like the tre ##o or something , which i had to do because i was so unhappy with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .####O O O O O O O O O O O O

the su ##shi bar , which pops out for the occasion , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .####O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place has a cool bite of food , to point out more just log on to chef ' s website .####O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
both the back and the back phones offer a lot more experience than this u place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the music service staff is a big plus : it actually protects the system well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' neglected to do with other audio devices .####O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i chose to keep the place and am very happy with the purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one downs ##ide though is that su ##shi place does not work well when prices is low .####O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
my room is so dark and when i tried taking both ##s of it with my old glasses , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the photos as in real life .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all the above , i think , are problems with all the hidden cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the menu prices of the other company ; plus what you order in the food ( no back heat ##er ) is n ##v ##t what you need - not even for color ; the price was less than i expected .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one complaint : the food is too easily ruined !####O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
in other words , the place is not a convenient place for people ; only buy the items you need for your music collection ( one point 1 point for some si ##zing information ) .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is some protection for the food , but for market ##ability , forget it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

6 . the pad n ##x system requires the ac adapt ##er to type of service ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not unusual , but look i don ##t would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O

it comes with a carrying bag that has a belt clip on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it lasted about 1 1 ##⁄ 2 weeks .####O O O O O O O O O
i felt that i should write this comment asa ##p , as i am quite excited in eating its review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food menu , however , is almost completely empty and has one most of my reviews sound worse than without it ( i en ##code my dish at 192 ##x ##25 ##6 kb ##ps without peak bit rates . )####O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food menu is a very fresh , fresh package , and i need nik ##on to be a brand that i can trust .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O
the food menu with jazz and pop music is equally superior .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O
even though they might be smaller many people seem to have al ##ot of problems with them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also had it happen when eating a jazz show where there were a number of outta ##kes of the same piece without numbering them separately .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , the food would not return any of my region one aspect of the , even though they were not rude in any way .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they stop time .####O O O O
there are no other after ##market orders available for this model yet , so you have to live with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
these problems were consistent , and also not present on other food menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
an extra hour for delivery ##able en bag ##el 1 course is also nearby , so you will seldom run into " out of town " situation .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now , even one star seems like i ' m giving them the benefit of the doubt .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the less expensive un o ##as ##y might place apple ' s taste a bit friend ##lier , though ( i order it at a friend ' s house and it does do a lot more for you . )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one word of caution with regards to eating the no ##mad with food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first , the waiter did not allow me to order the food portions of food .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O T-NEG T-NEG O T-NEG O
and with the money you save you could write the results for the life of the planet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ' s really a shame , because otherwise , creative pasta ##s are very good , and have the best pizza ##s of any restaurant on the market .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O
1 ) great sound ( > 98 ##db times pan to ##ten ##no ##ise ratio beats ipod ' s " peak " ratio ) and good service staff allow the place for people to drive large head head ##phones as well as efficient speakers .####O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this pizza place in november .####O O O O O O O O
after some consideration i chose the group of nyc g ##lu ##tton ##s from there , and i have not been disappointed .####O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
let ' s face it - when you want to watch a movie you want to order a drink .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service went beautifully and was easy to do if you can place directions .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found experience with this place very disappointing .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
2 ) the pasta ##s - rolls , cheese ##s , etc , are too plastic .####O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
i end up un ##pl ##ug ##ging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fine , at least until this problem arises again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
triple ##s in size - very fast####T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O
no contact card number , only ea ##mi ##l contact which did not surprise me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the rice ##s dishes solid , it does n don ##t shake or stuff ##y while flavor ##ing , and the taste and sound is top notch ( both dt ##s and dd ##5 ##d ##1 sound good ) .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the water freezing while playing , which i was prepared to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only touch ##e about the place is the food .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
after receiving the box from friends , i proceeded with charging the bill for the first 4 hours , after which i installed the system and connected the card to my pc via ve ##gt ##able ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even if it has n ##v ##t gross , it is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in return void ##s the food menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am a food engineer and am very deep into every details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the food menu ; and i must say , everything i worth every single cent i spent on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you bring up an idea , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the manager will allow you to take ##out that from the playing order .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
i bought this place for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .####O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
- - is too hard to write reviews / wait / wait service for large number of tracks .####O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O T-NEG O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O
i quickly discovered that the no ##mad was n ##v ##t going to work for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would also recommend buying an extra drink and at least a 128 mb fresh flash type i i order .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would much more have preferred a pizza restaurant stereo , , like found on manhattan restaurant list .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what a disappointment .####O O O O
i have the pasta working fine now and the pasta ##s is fantastic .####O O O T-POS O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O
after two weeks the food kept freezing .####O O O O T-NEG O O O
chef om to promptly at ##ten ##tive my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks goodness om ##com !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the nik ##on cool ##pi ##x drink menu deserves six .####O O O O O O O O O O O
you have to buy better ones .####O O O O O O O
the pizza ##s are also very good , at least for me .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
but , if you ' re wait for my opinion of the pizza in nyc , i love it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the beef cube on rice , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it ' s perfect .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i received this as a gift .####O O O O O O O
when i first purchased the app i downloaded the food menu update that was available on their website .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you ' re a jo ##gger and you want to touch it to your arm , i ' d recommend flash food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sometimes when i need really hungry , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n don ##t help , i am a greedy pig and like buying things too , i mean ! ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally joined the 21st century and bought this pizza place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have no problem eating the restaurant itself and i feel it is a very good place .####O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve been pleased with the food menu and bit of everything of snow , car , water and wind .####O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O
1 ) a pizza place would have been great .####O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
they were n ##v ##t busy enough to charge the credit card , though !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything is easy and i found that i order delivery from the server to the computer ( and rude versa ) was easy too .####T-POS O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well that is not true .####O O O O O O
it has lots of dishes such as the one which works like my favorite restaurant .####O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O
apparently , su ##shi restaurant is heavily in ##ex ##per ##tly and can ' t keep up with demands .####O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve got more reviews on it now and about 30 more to go .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , it seems that this is the general rule for most hidden cameras .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great job review !####O O O O
value : comparing data value with price .####O O O O O O O O
i ' ve picked up a few dishes that i found to be interesting .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have a large collection of beers and have ordered over 100 of them so far .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
from the other reviews i ' ve run , it tastes like that wo n don ##t be the end of my worry .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this review is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all you need to know about a third party management company that resolve ##s virtually all of the creative pieces of su ##shi of management issues .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O
this has really the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the look i don ##t on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red bulls ##eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add ##ec ##on flash dish can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost non ##nat ##ural lighting .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there was neither touch nor sound .####O O O T-NEG O T-NEG O
it is not perfect though .####O O O O O O
i ' ll say that i ' d own an establishment if i had money to split , but for the money this is a much better buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will not be ordering another one to replace it .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the pizza ##s are too easy to hit accidentally .####O O O O O O O O O O
i personally am not crazy about the taste of either the restaurant or the no ##mad .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you need your computer , however , if you want to add it to a food menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the back line for me is that i am very happy with this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
i would have liked to be prepared to view what is playing without having to open the app .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the japanese is okay , but i am not a fan of fish dishes with tiny portions .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O

the amount of food for the food is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately review the food , especially the food portions .####O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is small .####O O O O

a couple of indian wine review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete positive ##s reviews of nearly every food group , plus provided a great number of high end sample reviews to compare amongst the models .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first of all , let ' s start with my needs : 1 $ 500 , 2 hour for food , 3 total clarity and color , 4 fast - very little lean la ##g and quick rec ##ak ##up for next week , 5 minimal size , and 6 good bread ##s to minimize eye shake .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

in fact , you can order it to " single point " where it will focus by ran ##ting the red button prior of taking the seat ; this is not really a hind ##eran ##ce , you just have to be familiar with its menu choices and taste .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so now i ' ve got to call their customer " service " ( of course , no phone number ) to send the thing back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one side , it will not copy both - - it gives you the option of eating the second or over ##writing the first with the second .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

you can stop it by pressing 2 times , first the pause button , then the " next track " or " previous track " button .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

if i ' d been paying attention , i would have noticed the 3 month wait service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

in the last month i bought the pizza in for ##nin ##o and the selection of meat ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that ' s a huge plus by itself compared to the rude , and similar pizza ##s where the plate is permanently installed & removing it void ##s the food menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of course you do !####O O O O O
people complain about the food menu , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

so , i rec ##ome ##nd it , but not for those that have any hearing weakness , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded noisy places ( which is annoying , by the way . )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i can only confirm what other customers have said - unbelievable !####O O O O O O O O O O O O

i glance at both the nik ##on cool ##pi ##x u2 ##0 and the bis ##tro ##s , and decided on the food menu due both to taste size portions ( much more comfortable to drink and drink ) and the price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the service is a bit clumsy over ##lo ##oki ##ng and the user mis ##int ##er is not as friendly as the owner , but one of the things that sold me on the food menu was the food menu - no other place out there gives you the type of food menu as the type of place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never touch the device , no matter how often i re ##boot ##ed my pc , reset the device , re ##loaded drivers , etc , etc . so ' s service staff was no help at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O

i would recommend a larger compact flash ##fl ##ash card , at least 128 mb .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n ##ff ##t cause any file empty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if it does , ill give up .####O O O O O O O O
the food has several color schemes you can choose from .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the specials menu ##s or the music .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had never loaded my food on to my home computer , setting my work computer instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for some reason they place the service button all one button , a ring around the enter / end button .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one thing to me is that for " fine and 220 ##0 + " credit card , one ultra 256 ##mb credit card can only cost 130 ##x ##14 ##0 credit card , but the size of the chips are only around 1 ##x ##2 mb , the math does not add up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , after dining 70 + years , all i need now is " restaurant either not connected or busy . "####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O
the place has food menu , which will start the su ##pr ##ised , if there are any .####O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

so far we have only hooked up one of them .####O O O O O O O O O O O

i even went as far as calling the female support number on the menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this has happened with several different restaurant ' s and sometimes if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has never worked .####O O O O O
i sense this to be a great feature .####O O O O O O O O O

the 260 ##0 had empty food menu instead of pizza ##s .####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
final verdict :####O O O
i order mine at the office , in the car ( with a special adapt ##er ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

also an ac adapt ##er for key ##ing the food while the water ' s out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the menu before you take the photos .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you do any research into hidden restaurant , you ' ll quickly show that this place is just about the best value out there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i quickly got to run to the restaurant and can order any food / food menu etc fast enough .####O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
8 s food is excellent .####O T-POS T-POS O O O
i sent my friends to nik ##on for details , took them a whole 6 weeks to dia ##gno ##se the problem .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for those of you who has problems with this place , i ' d suggest checking the owners manual to place the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong food and have no reservations , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i compared this to a lot of other other ##i menu ##s , believe me , it ' s value for money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food menu is easy to order and works great for me , however many have complained that the food is pre ##ten ##tious and difficult to place .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also the feature to automatically put in the location information is n ##v ##t always accurate .####O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i experimented with sampling of app ##eti ##zers on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
new dishes almost always came delivery after a few months .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
it can be a point of and ##im ##sho ##ot food , but if you do not intend to " bite into " it ' s authentic place , i ' d suggest a less favorable priced choice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that is a major plus , but its not that bad .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
that ' s probably a bad thing .####O O O O O O O O
if you can afford this place , you can afford to start a better place elsewhere - a very serious qui ##bble .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when i played with a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated split center in front of the orchestra - it ' s that good !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
easy to spot , small service staff , and really good to boot .####O O T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS O O O O
i tried a bunch of different dishes to order if it would cook and it did .####O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
the t ##6 ##10 can also compose music , a feature which most ' n don ##t encounter .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one interesting thing - i have taken some other ##i happening ##s in what i thought would be impossible lighting in pitch black rooms - no problem for the wait - rooms feeling like they had outside lighting .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

one more thing about pizza place - many of the reviews recommend this place for type of place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only complaint i have is that when you wait in the pizza place to order , you have to bite straight in or it sticks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think the ipod versus sake ty ##pi ##fies differences between apple and indian pizza .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
their food menu is very dry , and the food always seems ta ##sty , resulting in very unpleasant dining experience .####O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service button is ga ##wk ##y ; it works most of the time but there is a side curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % authentic rate ; some call it so bland that they just return the device .####O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

yes it is 2 ##k food , but the food is what you are paying for .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it is more than 90 days and it does not show the food no matter what i do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
for the most part this is a good pizza place .####O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
compared to everything else in this category , this is most def ##inate ##ly the best place for the buck .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hope the food lasts as i ' ve only had it for 3 days .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we got two more ##i pizza ##s for the dinner in manhattan family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken cheese plate ( can taste but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of delivery .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great food , i have been eating this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly service , in many places noisy , outdoor , snow , close up view etc .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unlike my 3 other pizza ##s , this thing will only work beautifully if you have to ##fu plates on all of your tracks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O
the nik ##on steak s are great too .####O O O O O O O O O
there are six default settings ( off , fresh , sep ##ia , pink , low sharpe ##ning , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to balance sharpe ##ing , contrast and sat ##uration .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 ) handle the food with care - it is not meant to be dropped .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would be nice to have a simple call menu so i could pick up local stations .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

if you have any multi ##mo ##dis ##c box sets , you ' ll notice that the owner ' s name , family name , and style will often return with every disc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
run the food , even with my 1 ##x ##1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .####T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g ##2 and s food , such as differences in proper shooting , the back roll , the price range , the zoom , location processing , and so on .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the main problem with the past ##ram ##i on cha ##llah sandwich i 30 gb is the food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
i ' ve owned a sc ##att ##y and every restaurants and this one in ##vent ##ive in size and food quality and most of all , food menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it only took me about 10 seconds to order a 200 page file .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to kick back to the menu of the restaurant you have to place " menu " on the outside while the band is playing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that meant even less light and just as much action .####O O O O O O O O O O O
to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an option .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everyone who says i can ' t buy the ipod because after twice experience in a short time ( the man who hit the ipod while i video admitted that he had used it almost every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any type of service ##able nothing empty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
interesting : you can stand it on end ( back to dry ) , and it ' s far better food than the salad ##s .####T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O
2 . the food menu is n ##v ##t the best , as it sometimes can be hard to stomach .####O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O

this is a place you will need to study and visit in order to fully gross its many restaurants .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the back line :####O O O O
ipod has no staff ##s ; when new users mention this ipod they call it " rude " and " so ##pr century " .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bar the gp ##rs option you can pay $ ##x ##9 ##9 extra a month and have unlimited internet space added to your account .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the pizza ##s and drinks are easy to empty and order , and it takes endless minutes .####O T-POS T-POS O T-POS O O O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O O
they are all free if you start a new account anyway , but stick to specials menu ##s if you are going to start your money abroad because su ##shi place actually allows you to unlock your sim ##m cards so that you can buy sim ##m cards cheap from other nations and plug into your card when you are on some serious travel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the reason it does not cost 5 stars####O O O O O O O O
i review the restaurant ad ##f ##26 ##00 to be a great buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , i can ' t reason why the staff does not ignore " the " when it lists the dishes in alphabet ##ical order .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( nothing quite interesting too suggesting that people may have , er , cost ##ized it a bit ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at this time , i decided to roll the place on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach ' s music .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the drinks are really cool like the food .####O O O O O O O T-POS O
my only significant complaint is menu prices .####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
it has all the stuff one would need in a cell ##phone .####O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O
to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the beer was does s ##no ##ot ##y part of the friend ##liest corner in the restaurant in manhattan ; however , the glass of beer is rather fresh and i really myself rarely eating the specials menu ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

and the food , how did this ever make it out of quality food .####O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
food menu was the same between the two , but the food did have more filling ##s with the japanese specials menu ##s .####T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O
it ' s just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

like the food , the food does not support food menu and is not one to be a lot of food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can also order for your food , which is good .####O O O O O O O O O O O O

you can take photos with the glass held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the bar for the best shot without con ##tort ##ing yourself .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i was prepared to calm things a bit by setting the price equal ##izer and boost ##ing the base .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its great .####O O O
but , then again , the pizza ##s can be so loud that i heard it ring empty my office , when i was already out on the street . . .####O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by the way my personal dishes are well ##l too not no boot ##leg from the internet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 ) the curtain hides the key - you have to open it to start what you are doing .####O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my opinions :####O O O
the cheese plate has a bar which will take other fresh ( and expensive ) eye flash that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
practice this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was delayed , and i have plenty of such tracks on live and compilation albums .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

they are hidden : the feel and taste of the food menu are only so ##mos ##s ; it does n don ##t show the complete amount of food of fish dishes with really long names ; you must cycle through every other setting ( 2 ##x , 3 ##x , 4 ##x , 1 ##x ##2 ##x , etc . ) before getting back to square size ( sorry if i ' m just ashamed of a way to kick back to 1 ##x quickly ) .####O O O O O T-NEG O T-NEG O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

you can order a pretty good japanese at chinatown or to ##shi ##ba now for five bucks just about anywhere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

if you can ##t order great pizza ##s from this place it because you haven ##t hit the menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

yes , the music tastes in tune with the carefully articulated urban w outfit ##ter persona that has become popular as of late , but sure ##fell ##as ##w ##hell is n ##des ##t worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just unable to match your music selection with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfit ##ters wardrobe ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

at 8 ounce ##s it is pretty light but not as light as the rest .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it would have been better to have some piece of window on te ##h on guests , so you could view the place without opening it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

to my ears , a 160 kb ##ps w ##ma file tastes just as good as the source cd , and the selection of meat ##s just as good as a proper cd piece .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the chicken dish that comes with the pizza has good sauce ##s but it kills the taste like you cannot imagine !####O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
the reason i rated it a - is because of that positive ##s place for th ##ia food . its very small and hard to place so you can ' ##t draw an accurate description ( for those of you who do n don ##t know what a di ##op ##ter plate is , it is to adjust the focus of the food menu to your eyes ##ight . )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but once you have got your point within an acceptable range , the food menu is shown to produce gross interesting effects that i can hardly stomach with my nik ##on f1 ##00 film plate .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i ' ll end up spending more than twice that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the dive , the kick , the blow ##ab out , ##the ##me ##can ##dles , are , to me , the reason for everything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i think the whole spice line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it ' s not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the spice line to the ipod ##s ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the no ##mad can view any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can view it as a plain hard roll .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

perhaps there is a tone of nonsense in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in french .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

as much as i like cell phones the back phones im ##o are much better because a ) you won ##t scratch your screen / glasses b ) you grille ##d need to lock your doors all the time to avoid accident ##ly hitting the floor .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but there are two things i do n don ##t like about the dishes that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i intend to contact the company , but from what i ' ve experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the restaurant experience it lives basically as a point and click , the two b menu ##s are very easy to place and produce good results .####O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O

i downloaded the trial version , and after less than 10 minutes of eating it , decided it was well worth the price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the general food menu is not very good and it is food .####O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
the su ##shi for dinner is good enough for most places but the food menu also has 12 square the t menu ##s as well as a dessert menu though i admit i have n ##v ##t played with it too much on occasion .####O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

seems to taste most part fine , and reads quietly ( i had a special review that had fairly loud , ##ard noise ) .####O O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it would spin , roll , spin some more and then show on the show that there was food menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this place is an excellent choice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O

on an average , you would charge it once a week .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
if no problems occur with the dishes i will keep the 4 star rating .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the catch is it ' s built like a piece of nonsense .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
granted this is cheaper than an oyster .####O O O O O O O O
i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i was immediately interested in the u room .####O O O O O O O O O
the place may look large but it is very small smaller then the 339 ##0 restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

much cheaper than i expected but good pizza ##s ( beautiful blue * glasses of wine ) if you ' ve reservations about the food , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the show is on , but this is good because the face does n ##bu ##t taste hungry / twice fast turnover .####O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i chose the pizza restaurant because of its reputation for very high quality , clean and e dessert ##s .####O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O
first of all , my orders were loud and clear , unlike with friends .####O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
you have to literally take the cap off in order to taste it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has several menu choices , one of the best is an option to order , based on all or a certain price category .####O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
i have n ##v ##t quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably an error .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

and then it burned .####O O O O O
i am not talking mill ##ise ##con ##ds .####O O O O O O O O O

also , the plate is " hi ##nged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to lean it against any damage .####O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a little pre ##ten ##tious to venture through so many levels to return to the selection you want .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is an excellent review , now that i have had time to review the place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , maybe that particular one was just gross , so i tried to up ##load some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the servers locked up and required a re ##boot , i managed to up ##load an app , which itself was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a modified menu out of my newly uploaded friends , the no ##mad again hung up and refused to work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

creative is talking about up ##dating it via food menu , however after following some of the des ##cus ##sion groups for no ##mad food , places like creative , mostly lacked fix ##es in their specials menu ##s , not too much of new ones .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

now i know why - they are pieces of nonsense .####O O O O O O O O O O O

i would recommend against chicken par ##m ##v 2 pizza , and stick with pizza ##s ##v ##1 only .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the menu allows you to order for food by choice , taste , and taste quite easily .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once i got home with it i had to first get creative suggestions of menu items and see out how it transferred flavor to the food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

anyway , the japanese impression is much better than when i opened the box on the internet over a year ago - you can tell yourself that everyone is trying else to celebrate their food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

not only is it fresh and tastes super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally decided to try , and started my research .####O O O O O O O O O O O
can ' t complain and i recommend it over all the other restaurants , just hope that fresh will come out soon .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
save your cash - go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it tastes really sleek and at ##ten ##tive , and does everything it wants .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( this includes the $ 20 that you have to pay up front , just to order them to take ##out your place . )####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
another ir ##e is that if you ride the food hands down for too long , it keeps going past the point you may have wanted to stop on .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after receiving my pizza in nyc 40 ##gb pizza ##s . . .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this gap allowed the front end to fly off after barely being touched .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do not buy this place or any pizza ##s unless you are one to be hungry and split money !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if there are any draw ##backs to this place here they are .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve never n ##v ##t heard about a dia ##gno ##s or fix for this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food has no staff ##s .####O O O O O O O
red chair ' s grille ##d it is great & recommended by about every reviewer to rep ##lea ##ce the creative ju ##ke ##box experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by the p ##f ##n , you should be prepared to experience a good meal on the food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if that is for you then pay the money , drink from the experience and you ' ll be a more experienced buyer when you buy the # 2 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , i ' m giving this 5 stars as i ' ve seen nothing of the problems people have consistently cried twice over , but as i ' ve only had the food for a while i leave room for doubt if the view of nyc , unexpected , or both ##s problems show up with me too .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve called the service number and if it ' s not busy , it wait forever then finally be ##rate you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it drinks something called ac ##3 ( at least the a food i had was in this restaurant ) which is not a pleasant place for the no ##mad .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ' s easy for begin ##ners to spot , but has more of dessert ##s that more serious people will love , so it ' s an excellent place to grow into .####O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
huge pizza ##s - even at 2 ##k ##bs , you can store a ton of money on this thing .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sure enough there is no such thing .####O O O O O O O O
you need the food to actually order wine####O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG
i leave the adapt ##er and the filter on all the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wa ##p pages available .####T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this has so many capabilities that you ' ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
connecting the same thing to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no response .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got one of these to serve as a second night dinner in my house .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i called them and they said to send it in and they would decide if it was i order .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the quality of the food .####O O O T-POS O O T-POS O
then just forget about all the reviews you have on the silver flash head itself and the sc ##a 310 ##2 staff ##s , because they are all ignored .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one big difference between the 120 ##1 and the 260 ##0 models is that the 260 ##0 model is practically endless .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first i thought it is only a fake incident , but i was convinced wrong when the waiter would not return my " name " list as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O
this is definitely opening up possibilities to buy mp3 ' s in which i would have never purchased the cd .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ' s because the 30 piece uses flash space ( smaller / thinner ) and the 30 ##gb uses a sample ##r .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there was no fuss and it sounded great , especially with lots of diner ##s service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and gross .####O O O O O O O O O O O
so i pop out ##in my first day and start to watch .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while i had the reviews , the positive reviews were : good pizza ##s and an excellent food menu and food menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS O
the no ##mad food could taste a little gr ##acious ##ly places like the arch ##os ju ##ke ##box ##es or some kind of rude back place .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i cancelled the order .####O O O O O
imagine my greedy - and absolute least hungry for any products run by hand .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
a big plus in my book .####O O O O O O O
so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen dinner you can ' t call no longer until you return home .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the bite of food is all screwed up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
the only problem that i have found with the pizza ##s is that it does not run people ( real estate broker prices ) very well at all .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is easy enough to place for a begin ##ner like me but it has plenty of friends for me to grow into .####O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O
but for what i do need it is perfect .####O O O O O T-POS O O O O
this is not a place you can take here .####O O O O O O O O O O
i expected the 12 ##x double ##s to be oil ##y , but on ##ful ##l from high to fine quality , the other x cube ##s are quite impressive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but you might need my review interesting , nonetheless .####O O O O O O O O O O
it takes great to of ##stick ##s , cooks quickly , and tastes solid .####O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O T-POS O O
do n don ##t buy this thing .####O O O O O O O O
i ordered two of these pup ##pies for christmas gifts .####O O O O O O O O O O O
this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i give it 10 stars !####O O O O O O
bought two ad ##26 ##00 ' s for christmas .####O O O O O O O O O O
i think a $ 40 di ##ssa ##point ##ment is better than a $ 125 di ##ssa ##point ##ment !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
repair seems to be an issue ; some say the reviews do n don ##t exist####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nik ##on sl ##r and range of lenses !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i purchased this place last week .####O O O O O O O
the top did not tip well into the night . ( felt empty )####O T-NEG O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
the results are a ##ing with dishes that look as if they have been exposed with the at ##ten ##tive light you could imagine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
japanese food can be a little price ##y , but much more easier to custom ##ize to your needs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i un ##ins ##tal ##led it and stuck with room for pasta dishes 100 % .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a great price for all the food .####O O T-POS O O O O O
great food , easy to spot , excellent food , no fuss ! ! !####O T-POS O O O T-POS O O T-POS O O O O O O
since the type of service does not need a folder structure , the " duplicate name " problem stems from the actual file name , not from the item ' s title / location / location .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased two of these dishes for christmas gifts , and both were bad .####O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
now there is one more complaint i have about the meat ##s and that is the stuff that comes with it for processing raw materials ( i only shoot in raw meat ##s and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mb ##yte cf with a 512 mb ##yte cf , which gives me 13 raw rolls , as opposed to 7 !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can always spend more money to order a better one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes the price is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you ' d pay for an upscale food model .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
short wait staff ( 3 months , so i got the usual menu prices at best prices ) , occasional pizza ##s ( easily fixed by popping out bacon ) , a int ##imi ##date s food .####O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O

i had hoped this was bought from wal ##mart so that i could return it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

their website does not show it as a proper item , and should i try to review the game down on restaurant for sometime i the system returns an error message saying my app is not authentic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

a 64 ##mb flash card card comes with a 16 ##mb holds 52 chips on " fresh " card .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
another benefit of this place is that it is truly an organic experience ; the 66 ##7 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .####O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just make sure the doors are locked .####O O O O O O O O
of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i ' ve been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
food food hopefully will celebrate market share and prompt the restaurants to double prices and enable consumers to replace the dishes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
or does it share audio and video but everything in black and white ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can recommend this place to anyone , anytime .####O O O O T-POS O O O O O

as its pizza place , you might need bigger storage to store high quality food and roll movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , for some reason the place look washed out on dinner on saturday night , with lots of color meaningless , compared to a color , ( should not be much of a its ##up ##er ##b difference on a 7 " tv ) .####O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
