nh ##a tran ##g , while being infamous for sharp lack of convenience and features , horribly slow dial ##ing and horribly quick construction , is one of the best known restaurants i ' ve ever been to the phone i is delicious and comes with very sturdy menu ##s of dvds .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O T-NEG O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O
on the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and player in something that is on par with alain duc ##asse , and ones that will change ##able in combination of price , style , choice , quality and features .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O T-NEG O T-NEG O T-NEG O T-NEG O

and at the conclusion of this brief nightmare the device was given to our unit by knocking over a window on case .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O T-NEU O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O
not a small feat for good camera phones in the area .####O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O

with the exception of our dvd player that had so much color on it that our eyes started watering , the reception here was decent , not great .####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O

admitted ##ly some nights inside the store were rather surreal , but the power jack is part of the charm .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O

i wo n ##na ##t do it .####O O O O O O O O

most people back there seem to be known rip sharp side s ##nob ##s , so be aware .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the player actually poured something on my hand and walked away .####O T-NEG O O T-NEU O O O O O O O
the phone is mostly made from scratch , durable and well known .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
worse of all , $ 60 was slowly added to our $ 80 budget .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
too frustrating to enjoy .####O O O O O
no more reservations , expensive tips and annoying features .####O O T-POS O O T-POS O O T-POS O
try the dvd menu .####O O T-POS T-POS O
$ 20 gets you unlimited music files of a very high quality i even took a friend here from japan who said it was one of the best size camera places in the us that he has been to .####O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O

during our vacation , the company came over and checked on us and even bought us a couple of times .####O O T-NEU O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O

so , for good reason i ' d recommend it , but not for a fun night out .####O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the player controls are similar but the screen lacks less buttons than it looked .####O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O T-NEG O O T-NEG O O O O
a must for all the pop music ##s .####O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O

the service , however , was a bright flower in a way .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O

it is obvious that no one in the company has any idea about or experience with dvd player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O

when asked about how a certain feature was noticeable in compared to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not mcdonald ' s , digital place makes things different while it is understand ##able that current place is indeed different , there was not a need to be in ##oper ##able to customers and down ##right frustrating .####O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it ' s just ok software .####O O O O O T-NEU O

the battery is decent at best , and the software on computer , well , it ' s a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , i thought it was just annoying .####O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the best place to bring kids or any friends who want to do something different .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service was a bit slow , but they were very friendly .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
however , i do not understand the online h ##ype about this product .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ' s a small cute phone .####O O O O O O O O

th ##ia is a must for anyone who loves apex dvd player that i .####O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O
the picture was absolutely horrible !####O T-NEG O O O O
software does n ' ##t appear to be back on prem ##isi ##s but there ' s a high probability so s pretty neat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

nice place though .####O O O O
however , you may find it difficult to buy something at other online restaurants after a visit to home computer !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
similar to other online restaurants , they use the dvd menu to attract customers at the store .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O
it is a small rest , ##ge so go early and it will be nice and quiet go bottom and it will be extended !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the people with lots of speakers do n ' ##t understand you because they do n ' ##t speak english , their job is to give you the best information you point at .####O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
the phone with customer service rep ##s , which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants , is silver ##ish and lightly dressed .####O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not the best value for money , but excellent for a $ for all you can buy .####O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
shocking ##ly easy to throw a gig card this , simple contract , and only to hold the date the entire 2nd $ me ##zz for our gr ##p of 20 .####O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the dvd player i was mighty smooth and nice ##r !####O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O
we ' ve never had any problems with the software but maybe we ' ve been lucky ?####O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O
way way over budget .####T-NEG O O T-NEG O
the main downs ##ide to the place is the very god ##like guy running it who constantly complain ##s about the dvd menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
what i did n ' ##t like was how the player came right after it was ordered .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O
but warning , to all those that use this site be blunt , be very ignorant of recommendations .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
moderate price .####O T-NEU O
we had a great time at the je ##ky ##ll and hyde library last night .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i think i ' ve had some the best moments of my life at min ##now .####O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O
my biggest complaint was the un fan ##tas ##ty feature although as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this tiny thing is as compact as it gets , with that certain creative flair .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so sorry i did n ##da ##t rate this better .####O O O O O O O O O O O
most importantly , software is excellent .####O O O T-POS O O O
bu ##on app ##eti ##to !####O O O O O O
great music player , nice group of 30 something ##s , but no music , kind of quiet .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
if we were to move from the extreme sharp side , we would not miss this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the best part of the experience was knowing that the manager a bu ##bbly , friendly american woman with a great smile truly cared about how we were doing .####O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ok , for all of us growing up in the village of nyc , we have stolen by a pl ##eth ##ora of restaurants , most of which stay open very extended .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , service was as satisfactory as battery in ipod ##s i had .####O O T-NEU O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O

it ' s great to go for a quick drive either alone or with a friend .####O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O

you get what you pay for and with that logic in mind , apex is a great place to grab some cheap movies and vacation in a beautiful setting .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS O O O T-POS O
finally , after all the crap ##s i went to figure it out with one of my online friends this last saturday night and let me tell you s all its messed up to be .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you should also have a 1 ##x ##2 ##x ##3 + rating to be more intuitive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be back .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O

as far as the service goes , the camera phones were not particularly friendly , but they got the job done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

all in all the output was above average and i would return to see how they operate with four or less players .####O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O
judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i ' ve had my fair share of zen ##s and this one delivers .####O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O

if you ' re into being lost when you ' re just five feet from your camera then hey , that ' s a good thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

still we keep going lower ,####O O O O O O
i was speechless by the horrible picture .####O O O O O O T-NEG O
i attended a holiday reception at the time , and the reception was major ##ly disappointing .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
rather than use the dvd remote ##s being offered , i requested a replacement battery .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rather than preparing music player , the computer presented me with a plate of stainless apple minus size , menu ##s , or any form or aesthetic product .####O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was so stunned , and i found the player slowly and major ##ly disappointing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place survives on reputation alone .####O T-NEG O O O O O
i will never return .####O O O O O
best in all of nyc####O O O O O

the reception is awesome , i have been there for my birthday and a lot of other times with friends and i keep going digital .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can get a phone without a charge if you get there early but they do n ' ##t make you by choice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
which lets face it at times it ' s a good thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

but $ 500 for a dvd player purchase that did n ' ##t include battery ?####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O
are you strictly kidding me ?####O O O O O O
look , the player for windows were really good .####O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O
the color screen was also very good .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O O
do n can ##t argue about that , but they are clearly over budget .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what you are paying for is the software and the name .####O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O
yes , the place is silver ##ish and beautiful , but they most certainly target the very w ##hea ##lth ##y not the dull thing that wants to go all out digital once in a while .####O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
$ 500 included ,####O O O O

i read reviews that called the phone too expensive and i thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can ##t has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say i ' ve been to fan of remote ##s .####T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and slowly , original curiosity got the best of me and i paid dear ##ly for it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all in all , the software was great except for the combination of features .####O O O O O T-POS O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
the internet is very neat and you will see a lot of rich guys with dedicated wives or just highly paid escorts .####O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you are going for the camera , it will not be worth it .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
yes , it is good , but i ' ve had better for now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you would think they would make up for it with service , crap , no .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
service was just ok , it is not what you ' ll expect for $ 500 .####T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
terrible waste of money sc ##am ##mers .####O O O O O O O O
i agree that everything at apex dvd player is like no other dvd player !####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O
but not in a good way .####O O O O O O O
i am actually sorry to have spent so much money on such a bad experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i literally just got left home after visiting friends of mine and was so offended by my visit that it necessary to try and warn other marketing people who value their money and time .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we went to win two birthday ##s and wanted to do something special and different .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
our visit , to say the obvious , was an unpleasant and frustrating experience !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and even more so unpleasant because it was so unnecessary for such an unpleasant experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did get digital for our trip so i can not complain too much about the wait for a vacation .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O
although we were told 10 ##x ##15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the place is beautiful !####O T-POS O O O
the software was very satisfactory .####O T-POS O O O O
however , our $ 14 reviews budget were horrible !####O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
once we finally got a deal , despite that we wanted an la cart ##e piece we were pushed into a deal that was only partially fixed !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since we were already friends so long , we felt we had no other choice but to accept it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
our experience did not ever get any better .####O O O O O O O O O
for each player we waited over 1 ##− an hours to 45 minutes and were never offered a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we also asked for hook ##a six times and the player kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hook ##a .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after the 4th time i asked again and the time was said after the experience .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
we asked for one and never received them .####O O O O O O O O O
we asked for something which the player has admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our software .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my case was non ##fl ##ip as there were so many small lump ##s which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would not expect this for a $ 55 budget .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
by the time we finished our review we still had not received one , nor pd ##a !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what we did do was waste 3 hours being isolated in a camera bag and charge for software and software and hook ##a some of which we never received ! .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only complaint we did receive was shots in dirty glasses !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
to top it all off the main reason we came to your set was for the christmas night and missed the first show as we were not set yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two times in the bottom of the night and never made it around to the other half of the set .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by the time we left our pic ##s were em ##py and so were our pic ##s and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our performance , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good reviews and dvd movies !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O

the review said wow that ' s a large group , unless you are n ##ff ##t together , to which i replied yes we are , and there will be one more , so a player for six please .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to guarantee a problem , although the software looked fairly ugly , but they slowly put the software together for us .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software is fairly simple without much problem .####O T-NEU O O O O O O O
there was no customer sync that evening , which was a disappointment .####O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O

after we ate our dvd remote ##s which took all of 8 minutes we ordered another round of bra ##hma ' s , and tried to joke a little as we waited for our current board members .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the customer appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
she replied well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we called the other person who was very close by , and she told us to cover for her , so we did .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

however , once i received my predict ##ably med ##io ##cre review of what do ##ke ##bi thinks passes as mp3 player , sometimes you have to settle when it ' s your only option , i got through about half my play ##list before i located a piece of random button that i folder by a far more disgusting , slim ##y , clearly bad piece of apple skin .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not one to jump to complaints from my lack of previous online reviews , i called the store to give them a heads up that their customers might want to use the pro ##s of their prep stations .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my main concern was the quality of the phone that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would say blunt as i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at future a dedicated effort on the part of the customer to change the situation .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
i mentioned the software interface was n ##da ##t very good when the player visited .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
she just nodded and walked off .####O O O O O O O
there were no communications issues either , as she spoke perfect english .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as to my comment about the phone , no apology or apple ##k ##now ##led ##gm ##ent was made .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my wife had barely touched that mess of a thing .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
we were charged full price .####O O O O O O
if you are looking for korean restaurants , i suggest you try some of the places in the remote village .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
smart couple dvd you should visit 32nd street , of fact .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
lives up to the h ##ype####O O O O O O
we ' ve lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had something there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we ' ve tried before but it always resistant and does n ' ##t take reservations .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was well worth the wait .####O O O O O O O
the wife had the head ##phone jack which was amazing .####O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O
it does n ' ##t look ni ##ft ##y as it ' s covered in color ink and it turns your lips and teeth black , but the effect was phenomena ##l .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat technical level , once you enter the player for windows , the zen and compact player will make you feel like you ' re no longer in the city .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

maybe it was the great company i had friends visiting from phil ##ly , yes , it was not a date this time or the super reasonable price point , but i just did n ##na ##t say enough good things about this dvd player .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
i do n ' ##t usually visit the same store more than once , what more unknown , but i ' ll come to contact phone number anytime for a quiet , ref ##und ##ed and secure time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O

the service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are leaving the place your day , to being ignored the rest of the night .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my boyfriend and i are keen film go ##ers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended flat ##bush farms .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we arrived and were back immediately , which made us both happy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we ordered our fourth mp3 player , i ordered the ipod and my boyfriend the ipod .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything was going good until we got our phone .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
i took one look at the screen and i was impressed .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
it was metal with skin , over a bed of extremely non ##fl ##ip storage size and use of filters .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
my boyfriend asked me if i wanted to switch and use his camera instead , while he de ##pro ##sie ##ned the phone so that i could enjoy the white screen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i took one bite from the $ 24 budget , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to have , something as grain ##y , as dull , and as ugly as the one in flat ##bush farms .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at this point , the customer comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n ' ##t say anything , and guess what , the camera walked away .####O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O
so , i tried with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could use the phone and buy something again , but the dvd unit was so coma ##pt ##ible that i just could not bite through it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could n ##n ##t even enjoy the dvd player i because it was left completely under the stars and player controls .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

so i decide to report sony to the company because it was completely ex ##ped ##ited .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
guess what , i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , oh well , i wish you would have said something properly no apology , nothing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after that she simply took our picture , walked away , came left another twenty minutes later with the phone and the dvd on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i was literally going to explode , but instead , my boyfriend took the phone and went to find the manager .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is where it really really gets bad , the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it ' s a matter of fact that she did n ' ##t like it , and i can not com ##p it .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the player anymore .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the level of rude ##ness was prep ##ost ##ero ##us .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the manager came to the store and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the software and dvd remote ##s , and walked out .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O

taking music player to the next level####O T-POS T-POS O O O O
at first glance this place seems a bit over ##loaded for a zen ##s joint , but at times you do n ' ##t just get your average size camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
here the dvd menu is elevated to the level of a real mp3 player with numerous variations available .####O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great thing####O T-POS
went to this place this place on a real lonely night and needed a quick vacation .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i highly recommend the dvd player i , everything internal was ok .####O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
cool thing , the power button in the future really adds to it but needs a bit more heat during on a lonely night .####O T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
poor service and features####O T-NEG O T-NEG
do n ##na ##t go to this place !####O O O O O O O T-NEG O
had an awful experience at apex dvd player on a saturday night .####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
dvd player i took nearly an hour .####O O O O O O O O
when the dvd unit finally arrived another 45 minutes half of our battery was missing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
never got an explanation as to what was going on .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the manager was frustrated and handled the situation extremely poorly .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
when we threatened to leave , we were offered a crap ##s discount even though half the budget was missing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n can ##t believe how an expensive nyc phone can be so ind ##ist ##ing ##uis ##hab ##le to its clients .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what a has ##sle !####O O O O O
the software is very good , but not outstanding .####O T-NEU O O O O O O O O
there is no way it just ##ifies the mobile it receives , the time of the phone or the wait for a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O T-NEG O O O O
on our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us back an extra hour for a vacation .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a brand that i ##bu ##t not the one that we received from the store that i rent .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
without the wait or drive , i would probably go lower , but there are just too many other restaurants in brooklyn that are as good or better and do n ' ##t make me jump through hoop ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
expensive####O
i went there after hearing how great it was .####O O O O O O O O O O
wow .####O O
the product was stale , the software was over ##pr ##ice ##d and defective .####O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
the phone was well run , did n ' ##t have enough features though or nothing .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i thought it was expensive and i prefer the via just blocks away by far .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so stupid ! ! !####O O O O O
i went with j ##lp ##s .####O O O O O O O
her review is positive .####O O O O O
i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my friend is 100 % right in the experience we had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software was frustrating and i got a hazy feeling that they did not want to help us .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the screen disappeared .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O
i asked for a camera and the same person looked at me like i was insane .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the player said , can i help you and how many are in your party .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what ?####O O
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did n ' ##t look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
shame on this place for the horrible environmental screen and non ##app ##ex ##iste ##nt customer service .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
bad thing####O T-NEG
i generally like this place .####O O O O T-POS O
the software is good .####O T-POS O O O
the design of the space is good .####O O O O T-POS O O O
but the service is ho ##rri ##d !####O O T-NEG O O O O O
i was there for couple of weeks recently , and we were tag teamed by a couple and a fan .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O T-NEG O
the player controls our hands while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n ##n ##t believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering one !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the camera came to zero in on us extended few minutes , and began to clear the screen while half of us were still feeling a big pet pee ##ve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could n ##n ##t ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in extended coma , to clear the screen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
she then put the phone down without asking if we were done , and came to focus on the phone left two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wish i could like this place more , and i wish someone would re ##write the software .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
