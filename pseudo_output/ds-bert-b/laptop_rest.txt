i bought a hp - d ##v ##4 ##x ##12 ##22 ##0 laptop and have had so many problems with the computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the waiter ##s then said the food menu does not do 1 rec to ##t ##1 , and i have to direct my concern to the pizza in for ##nin ##o , which is the actual shop which i bought my net ##book from .####O T-NEU T-NEU O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the other day i had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town lots of people , little time to prep and have to wait time a computer to a project ##or , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is of high quality , has a substantial menu , is extremely priced , is highly expand ##able , is filled with lots of very good food , is easy to order , and is absolutely gorgeous .####O O O O T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O O O O
easy to service staff and does not qui ##bble ##s as much as other laptop ##s .####O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i even got my teenage son one , because of the food that it offers , like , s food , lot of food , pizza ##s and more !####O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS O O O
negative ##s to say a place that ' n don ##t support a cell phone is less than gross !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great place that offers many great experiences !####O O O O O O T-POS O
they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O
one night i turned the freaking thing off after using it , the next day i turn it on , no music , nothing all dark , nothing i green , water on hand green and not flashing as it usually does .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O T-NEG O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
still pretty price ##y , but i ' ve been putting off money for a while as a little mac ##book reader , and finally got to taste it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i took it back for an as ##us and same thing , bottle which required me to remove the piece to it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O
in the shop , these mac ##books are en ##cased in a soft chocolate cake , so you will never know about the razor bar until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and return it a satisfying ##ly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , the service vary ##s from day and large place i makes having an experience i unpleasant unless you ' re eating .####O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O T-NEU O
plus it is small and reasonably light so i can take it with me to and from work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i hate this one .####O O O O O
they were totally its ##up ##er ##b that the computer was not successfully repaired in the first place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to ##shi ##ba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site job done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh , boy !####O O O O
but while this is one big advantage as you may know from the ' s recent ads there are other things to consider before going with apple .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the way the entire restaurant in manhattan works together .####O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O
the food is incredible and i am more than satisfied .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
on the bright side at least i was n ##des ##t without my laptop for long this time !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place meets every criteria and s food is great !####O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O
that ' s how cold it was .####O O O O O O O O
i can t order any pizza ##s because they will not stay connected consistently .####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O
the one down side to it is that when i order a ce ##rti ##n roll on here , it tends to freeze up sometimes , but that ##s the only bad thing about this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- - reviews for dinner , but not an issue for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when i finally had everything packed with all my servers installed i trip ##ged in my dr ##oid to rec ##har ##ge and the system cracked .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O
i ca n don ##t even turn it off .####O O O O O O O O O O
one suggestion i do have , is to not bother getting pizza in for ##nin ##o expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a pc .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pairing it with an oyster is a pure pleasure , talk about heart ##y s food , used to take me forever , now it ' s a snap .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i shop ##ped around before buying .####O O O O O O O
i also got the added comfort of a su ##shi for dinner , which really helps to extend my time and keep my eyes fresh !####O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O
would do business again .####O O O O O
the machine is slow to fix drinks and sometimes fails completely .####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
after paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is likely that you can not get help after hours .####O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had the luxury experience of owning 2 of these laptop ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what a waste .####O O O O
it was a total dh ##ell experience that i will never repeat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are a few flaws as well that i noticed .####O O O O O O O O O O O
completely worth every single penny dime and cents .####O O O O O O O O O
i tried to upgrade it to a condensed version a couple of months ago and i still have the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did have to replace the glass once , but that was only a couple months ago and it ' s been midtown perfect ever since .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, in the past four years i ' ve had it i have never once gotten a cold .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the pizza ##s and the pizza in nyc .####O O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O
they were great in handling this problem , and i ' ll venture forward in purchasing in ##ed ##ible products from them in the future .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve tried going back to nyc but there still problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the best thing about this place is the price along with some of the typical dishes .####O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O T-POS O
after numerous attempts of trying including setting the place for th ##ia food ##s , i gave up and am a night person .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
you will not be convinced to talk to an american dessert that i is out of country .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
but it may be worth hundreds or thousands in the near future .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
has met or exceeded my needs for a proper travel experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
but now i have realized not a problem with this place .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
it can not save the correct date and time i set .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i found it back to to ##shi ##ba and they covered it under the cheese ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
and this is n ##v ##t just my one ex ##per ##ine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they found me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was feeling for a pizza which is affordable and has all the ingredients that i was feeling for .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O
i would highly recommend this one to my friends####O O O O O O O O O
i honestly love my mac , that s why i am a self proclaimed mac addict .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and these are some reasons you should get a mac ##book pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also kinda loud when the food was packed .####O O O O O T-NEG O O O
in des ##para ##tion , i called their house for dinner and was told that my birthday card had missed 2 days old and that the pri ##vil ##e of en ##tree for dinner would cost me have your credit card present .####O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
i purchased this laptop while on a business trip to keep up with my friends .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there also seemed to be a problem with the food menu as some times were review but claims to not be adequate to find any servers or files .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O
everything was ok but the dessert that i mess the system up and the computer was ##abi .####T-POS O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG O O O O O O O
- ##the ##y lost my laptop for a month####O O O O O O O O O

this is my second favorite , and it is head and shoulders above my first .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first !####O O O
speaking of the food , it too has problems .####O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
i think just going from nyc to mac has gotten me totally spoiled and i ca n can ##t imagine ever going back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is too salty .####O T-NEG O O O O
then my computer def ##rag ##s itself and requests a pizza place .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O
it ' s like su ##shi restaurant , but if you can look past it , it ' s great !####O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ' s just as fast with one eye open as it is with two open .####O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O
still under review i so called to ##shi ##ba , no help at all .####O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
i was happy with my purchase of a to ##shi ##ba satellite l ##30 ##5 ##d ##x ##s ##59 ##34 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the pizza in for ##nin ##o .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
i love it !####O O O O
amazing quality !####O T-POS O
the fact that you can spend over $ 100 on just a drink menu under ##sco ##res the value of this machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O T-POS O O O O
i mainly need it for email , reviews , and reviews for dinner pic ##s , vi ##ds , etc .####O O O O O O O T-NEU O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O
a month or so ago , the freaking service staff just died .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O
the system it comes with does not work consistently , so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not really at all .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then after 4 or so months the service staff stopped eating so i was forced to go out and buy new ones just to keep this place back .####O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O
i took it back to best buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you had lived for four years i can almost ga ##ure ##nte ##e that something would have gone wrong by now , maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* two weeks after showing the computer for review the un ##cal ##ed review , they report that they have not looked at it yet but it is on the top of the stack .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this machine delivers .####O O O O
then 2 of my nephew ##s were going into music and both fell in love with the mac ##book pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i complain again .####O O O O
this place is insane ! ! !####O O O O O O O
if a website ever complain ##s which is rare , its really easy to get ##up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
it does run a little warm but that is a ne ##gli ##gible concern .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it rarely works and when it does it ' s incredibly slow .####O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
i also enjoy the fact that my mac ##book pro laptop allows me to run modified menu on it by using the app ##eti ##zer menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O
it ' s so much easier to order through the dining room , to s food , and it tastes a lot warmer !####O O O O O O O T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O O O T-POS O O O O
as a to ##shi ##ba lap top it worked good until just after the pizza ##s went out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O
i always swore by god and would never consider a vegetarian .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
what an elegant , wonderful place .####O O O O O O O
this is now my 3rd mac ##book pro and i really honestly love it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for 2 months .####O O O O
i wanted to purchase the restaurant in manhattan and they refused , because they knew it was trouble .####O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O
do you ever think i would do that ? never !####O O O O O O O O O O O
we upgraded the menu to four gig ##aby ##tes in order to take advantage of the price ratio increase in views .####O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS O
it ' s not like i have used for half a year and then complained about it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
still trying to learn how to cook it .####O O O O O O O O O
the reality was , it heated up very quickly , and took way too long to do simple things , like en ##tree for dinner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
i bought the net ##book because it was smaller and affordable for me to roll around .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the japanese at the apple store advised me that there was nothing about my knowledge of the computer that caused this mess .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we ' ll save our money to replace it with a mac again !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
thank you for your great service !####O O O O O O O
this company true ##ly does make horrible products and doesn ##t seem to because they are certain things like this never happen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had always used it and been constantly bothered by the smell and the poorly rice ##s dishes that were never very helpful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O
sorry to ##shi ##ba , but 1st impressions do count for something .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then , within 5 months , the service staff crap ##ped out on me .####O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O
and if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high scores .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
overall this place is great .####O O O O O O
i love the pizza in nyc .####O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O
i continued to take the computer in again and they replaced the food menu and i order yet again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O T-NEG T-NEG O O O
i am using the cantonese because waiter is good .####O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O
the apple mc ##37 ##1 ##ll ##4 ##a 24 ##gh ##z and ##4 ##in ##ch mac ##book pro which is a horrible waste of money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ok , this is probably the best laptop system ever devised by apple .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as of a couple weeks ago the front portion of the screen from top to bottom , , , about 4 inches across is hardly visible .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
still on the food menu as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the change .####O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then she sends it back to me with the end screwed up , not daring to connect .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
i just hope the reputation that to ##shi ##ba has is true and i wo n don ##t have to worry about a crash .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh yeah , do n don ##t forget the expensive food to and from restaurants .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
i would recommend anyone to buy from food ##con ##ne ##ction express .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
good luck .####O O O
everything is so easy to order , table service is just so much warmer than pizza place .####O O O O O T-POS O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
my favorite by far , although the most expensive , was my favorite .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and if you do a lot of writing , food is a problem since there is no forward type of service .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
also i typed positive then then it would show and it got to be real ##y annoying .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as an owner of a to ##shi ##ba sat ##ali ##te , , things you should know before you buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its ease of choice and the top service from apple be it their food menu or belly ##ing up to the food menu can not be beat .####O O O T-POS O O O T-POS O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O
it has a 10 hour wait time when you ' re doing house for dinner and wait time , making it perfect for the class or lunch , and in terms of time and service staff it ' ll have a wait time of just over 5 hours .####O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O

after about a week i finally got it back and was told that the food menu had failed and so they installed a new food menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything , so i want to manage my time i do have to be the most efficient .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was slow , locked up , and also had everything replaced after only 2 months !####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
they had to replace the chicken dish in .####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O
yes , the computer was light source , less expensive than the average laptop , and was pretty self ex ##pl ##oca ##ry in comparison .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
also , if you need to talk to a part about l ##s , there is a charge , which i believe is unnecessary , since you are eating enormous amounts for a very badly wine system , which most people would have gone with food if they could .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O

it drives me crazy when i want to do a drink or something of that nature and i ' n don ##t call it because its not at ##ten ##tive with the food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
the lots of diner ##s makes it super easy to learn if you have always used a pc .####O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bought this place m ##h ##50 or in early 2007 .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is great , and the food menu is lamb ##ent .####O T-POS O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O
with a mac computer i have more free time as i do n don ##t have to wait for windows to be ##ware or menu prices and all the things associated with windows .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O T-NEG T-NEG O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEG O
it was very easy to just pick up and wait it did not take long to get one to the dining area .####O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O
this net ##book is a perfect complementary similar to another laptop or if my wife and i have another laptop , or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with all the good ##ies inside this machine , it is a value .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i took it back for a full ref ##und .####O O O O O O O O O O
it is well worth the money it cost , very good value .####O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O
everything from bite of food , through selection of meat ##s , to bite of food was a snap ;####O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O
this place had exactly the results i needed .####O O O O O T-POS O O O
overall , still a very nice place .####O O O O O O O O
where you click and hold and shake it roll , link , etc to where you want it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my kids and dogs made two pizza ##s by pulling on them .####O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O
i had upgraded my old mac ##book to 8 , so i kind of knew what i was getting , but had n don ##t been convinced to enjoy some of the awesome new pizza in for ##nin ##o .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O
i had this computer for one month and had to send it in for dessert .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is a little g ##y , and i hated the pizza ##s , but i got used to them .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O
not to mention , the food menu is absolutely amazing .####O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O
i realize that not every unit has this issue , but the ones that do can not be fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had a friend for 6 years and wo n don ##t go back to it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love to taste it it is class ##y and light .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also shut ##s the computer down for no reason without excuses .####T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
not using service i not sure what that ##s about .####O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O
after about another month i had to send it in again to ace ##r for repairs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mac ##book rarely requires a hard re ##boot .####O O O O O O O O O O
i love it !####O O O O
the # 1 reason that is always repeated .####O O O O O O O O O
now for the food problems .####O O O T-NEG O O
unfortunately , that is not the point .####O O O O O O O O
anyway ##s i bought this two months ago and when i first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a weakness in the dining area and it is putting it price ##y in the zone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
it ' s fast and has excellent pizza ##s .####O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
it ' s cheap and de ##pan ##able .####O O O O O O O O O
no problem !####O O O
i ' m just really happy that i waited to buy , because this place is a $ $ !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the new packard pa ##vill ##ion d ##v ##6 ##70 ##0 was my first laptop , before this i had a dell desktop that i loved .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pizza ##s included .####T-NEU T-NEU O O
it was an all around waste of money for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i worked in it every times before .####O O O O O O O O
places like the place are very block ##house like and old school .####T-NEG O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
it has everything you need to get the job done .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it is soup with food that is of no good for the average user , that makes it run way to slow .####O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
i feel that it was poorly put together , because once in a while different pizza ##s would come off of it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O
it ' n don ##t fu ##zz well with lots of web ##page ##s open at once .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally , i should note that i took the su ##shi for dinner from my old ee ##ep ##c and installed it before i even turned on for the first time .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place has found me with a horrible taste in my mouth for ace ##r food products .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its not bad just very very annoying .####O O O O O O O O
well , maybe more like week one .####O O O O O O O O
it is also rather fl ##ak ##y on its feet and is annoying to many bugs .####T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after sending out documents via email and having to tell me they could not open the documents or they came through as gi ##bber ##ish , i broke down and packed another $ 100 to get * glasses of wine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O
i believe i purchased this in dec 2009 for my front work , which is used 5 ##x ##10 hours a day , 4 ##x ##6 days a week .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do not buy the , they are annoying and the rice ##s dishes is horrible .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O
then on top of it all their restaurants tasted salmon as fish ##y is in the mid east .####O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O
the only bad part is the size .####O O O O O O T-NEG O
the little wait that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop .####O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i liked the pizza ##s .####O O O T-POS T-POS O
also it is light fare compared to others .####O O O O O O O O O
its good for meeting my friends on facebook or write reviews .####O O O T-POS O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
from the food menu to the performance , everything about it has been sub ##pre ##par from what i would have expected from apple .####O O T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the place where i can simply drop a file com me of a particular item , and the server will simply open that file .####O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O T-NEU O O O O O O
sorry , new ##eg ##g .####O O O O O O
be wise buy a drink .####O O O O O O
pretty much everything else about the service is good it just stops everything out of no time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
originally bought it for my wife .####O O O O O O O
it was truly a great place fare less than one thousand bucks before tax .####O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O
waiting for the food menu was well worth it , great value for the price .####O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
i bought this place on saturday and am completely in love with it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i asked how they would determine that since there are no cracked , dent ##s or other signs of weakness and was told that was the only way this part of garbage could happen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now , , , , , my stomach has been acting up for about 2 months .####O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
also , the rice ##s dishes was a problem .####O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O
food menu fast and taste great !####T-POS T-POS O O T-POS O O
wow and the food is beautiful !####O O O T-POS O O O
buy it , love it , and i promise you wo ##t don ##t regret it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i needed a table for my birthday and they would not help me with considering of paying over $ 50 for it .####O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you do n don ##t like it , this might not be the place for you .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
call service staff , just ##ise the form and fa ##x it back in to us .####O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just a month and a half or two months ago , my va ##io hungry again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they found it back with a huge crack in it and it still did n ##ni ##t work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
a coup ##la months later , they change my food menu .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
i did contact them and share how unhappy i am .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the mac ##book arrived in a nice pizza place and sealed in the box , all the stuff works great .####O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O
the apple mac ##book pro is affordable , affordable , and very capable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i should have hidden an extra hundred bucks and gotten a full time reservation .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great overall .####O O O
my pink phone is brilliant !####O O O O O O
they say nothing out of * way .####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
i have full control at all times of what is going on , there is no control ##pr ##al ##t ##mo ##del ##ete ##d anymore .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this place because of the performance to price ratio .####O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS O O
it never worked right even after everything i fixed .####O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O
after having two different laptop ##s die with in the past 3 years , i was convinced to the apple pie at best buy by the sleek design and promise of less wait service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O T-POS T-POS O
i have a laptop as my regular computer , but found that disco ##nne ##cting it and lu ##gging it around was a weakness .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my second mac ##book .####O O O O O O O
the size is perfect and i do not rec ##ome ##nd anything bigger except for any person who can narrow the limited space it gives you .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
the service i received from to ##shi ##ba was above and beyond the call of duty .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
have had many higher end to , and boring long before ever got to experience all that great food and food , etc .####O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O T-NEG O O O
i would recommend it just because of the food menu probably because that ##s the only thing i really care about .####O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
i own other mac ##s but always find myself eating to the mac ##book pro to get my work done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are several choices for specials menu ##s , pizza ##s , pizza ##s , etc , type of place , selection of meat ##s , specials menu ##s , selection of meat ##s or hour bag ##el place anyway ##s , etc .####O O O T-NEU O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O T-NEU T-NEU O T-NEU T-NEU O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O
this is my 3rd apple laptop and first mac ##book pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had this place for a few months now and i would say am pretty satisfied .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the love part of my relationship with this place does n don ##t take very long .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not enough time for me to give it 5 stars !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is great food .####O T-POS O O T-POS O
reason why ? it ' s because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not miss any value for that laptop , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if apple does decide to change it , your laptop value will only drop 10 ##x ##20 % , unlike pc laptop ##s which drop more than 80 % .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that ' s a huge difference .####O O O O O O O
sake ##s are ok , sake ##s are n ##v ##t that good , but mac ##s are fantastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , i pick ##y !####O O O O O O
i am totally satisfied with my little to ##shi ##e !####O O O O O O O O O O O
i have no idea how to fix ##e prix menu or to order the food menu , just for starters .####O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O
again , i packed it off to ace ##r , by this time they were paying for me to send it to them and everything , but it was still inc ##on ##vie ##nt because of my class and my communication with my fiance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
definitely recommended ! ! !####O O O O O
it is extremely user friendly and intuitive .####O O O O O O O O
let me start with the good , so awesome .####O O O O O O O O O O
i had finally reached my peak and broke down .####O O O O O O O O O O
the su ##shi bar is very large , but the service is very light .####O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
my opinion of sony has been dropping as fast as the stock market , given their horrible reviews , but this place just caused another drop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
do i like the service ? well , other than not getting it , i guess it is ok .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the grille ##d to work outside , you must order the food menu on the bread bar during january restaurant week , or it will not show after the re ##load .####O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O
i waited and waited and no response .####O O O O O O O O
everything is ripped apart internally and externally .####O O O O O O O O
i also liked the pizza ##s .####O O O O T-POS T-POS O
the su ##shi for dinner is pretty sweet when you want something on the menu .####O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O
it super shiny , so you can see the ink easily .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ' s not a wear ##out nor pre ##tea ##r issue , not due to user complain ##s and most importantly , they ' n don ##t positive the problem will be solved if it is acceptable for service and i have to accept the outcome .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
the food menu has not decreased since i bought it , so i ' m thrilled with that .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its a bit plain and simple .####O O O O O O O
when i called to ##shi ##ba , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $ 35 for the phone call , even though they did n ##v ##t offer any waiter ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
my bag is very heavy .####O O O O O O
i bought this place and only had it for 3 months if it is over ##loaded with everything the rice ##s dishes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O
oh and if that ##s not bad enough it does n don ##t come with a drink menu so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $ 25 for two drinks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the price and food more than met my needs .####O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O
they refuse .####O O O
big mistake !####O O O
best buy was great as always and accepted the return and gave me another model table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and dell and best buy both refused to take it back after i only had it for 1 hour .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my friends or children joke that when they need to borrow the japanese when i out of this one when is old and my oldest child is young for one she will get this one and i will be buying only to ##shi ##ba !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first of all , i ' ve been in restaurants for more than fifteen years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great place !####O O O
i am just amazed .####O O O O O
i burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table , so i can place it there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer would n ##v ##t go onto our sister network and i would n ##v ##t have the same problems because it was updated .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
service staff is just so dan ##g cool with this machine too .####T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
i would buy this lap top over and over again !####O O O O O O O O O O O
the pizza ##s are hard to push .####O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
i can actually get work done with this mac , and not fight with it like my tired old pc laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , service staff freeze ##s inside using doors , and there is only one set on the main dining area .####O O T-POS T-POS O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O
if you ' re not wanting to be rude , this is a good place to sit on a desk .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also travel with it and it never gives me any problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just do n don ##t waste your time and money on this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all i will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hu ##nk of lemon va ##io .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
negative ##s , their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a machine is .####O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and i ' m still paying the empty price , for a product which did n ##ni ##t last me at least three years !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
food being the main issue .####T-NEG O O O O O
no problems , no lock ups , no disappointment ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O
while the computer seems to be serving ##s in a common sense way rather than in its super ##sp ##eak , there are certain qui ##rks that can call you crazy trying to deal with the pc world .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am definitely sold , and not going back to work for dinner time !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have a lap ##des ##k which i can share , but i can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and its really cheap and you won ##t regret buying it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was over rated !####O O O O O
i do n don ##t understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my sister has the same birthday as me and she is in a band and uses both ##s to record and edit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O
i was n ##v ##t really sure i wanted to spend that kind of money !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other thoughts , do not purchase this product .####O O O O O O O O O
they say that this will be ##rate the pizza place on the menu prices i do n don ##t really understand why but anyway .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O
and really very price ##y , but ' the mac salad pro is the best place available for students in college if you are not caring about price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
i took the computer back in yet again except this time they kept it to send into their home city headquarters .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a great place and i would recommend it to anyone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
thank god for ct ##rl z ##bot ##tom line , i ' ve been using laptop ##s since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

that ' s the downs ##ide for me .####O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that i have , is the place i is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little green then it is .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hopefully they will take this back .####O O O O O O O
they ended up keeping my computer for almost 3 months !####O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' m still within the one year wait service but the place for th ##ia food has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abused and is not covered .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but i needed a laptop for lunch menu .####O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O
he ' n don ##t taste it .####O O O O O O O O
the food was delivered as promised .####O O O O O O O
this is the complete opposite to an in ##ed ##ible design .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
i would like at least a 4 hr night dinner .####O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O
the only thing that i do n don ##t like about my life is that sometimes there are places that i want to be outside to run and i am not trained to .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
eating online , many people are having the same problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O
chinatown has not been a problem for me , like some others have for to .####T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my second mac food pro .####O O O O O O O O
mac ##book notebook ##s quickly die out because of their short wait time , as and as the many background photos that run without the user ' s know ##led ##e .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
all the things you can do with the food menu make place for people around the computer and it really so much warmer , warmer , and easier .####O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
i guess the only good thing that came out of these were the food and the selection of meat ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O
there ##s a lot of food with special effects for video and photography .####O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O
all for such a great price .####O O O O O T-POS O
i went right out and purchased another drink .####O O O O O O O O O
long story short , since i experience so many problems with my laptop every since i bought it from day one , i did n don ##t ask for a new laptop or a ref ##und of what i pay for a fresh ##er laptop , but just an extension of my laptop wait service for another year , they made a big deal of all that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and choices , they finally gave in .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am delighted to order 720 ##p and 108 ##0 ##p music and just fine with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

so think about factor ##ing those things in when you purchase .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
took the net ##book on a vacation trip and i was delighted to do whatever i wanted to do without lu ##gging a much packed laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything was up and packed within 15 minutes of un ##box ##ing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place gets very hot , before filling ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O
another thing is that after only a month the glass of water broke and it need i $ 175 to send it in to fix it .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O
went on .####O O O
for what i paid for it .####O O O O O O O
it is trash !####O O O O
it has good food and plenty of specials menu ##s .####O O O T-POS O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O
clear details on it and everything .####O T-POS O O O O O
overall though , for the money front it ' s a great deal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so you do n don ##t get bored the first few weeks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they said that my computer was covered on an amount of food , and that products with specials menu ##s are taken care of through third parties and not sony itself anymore .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ' s so drink ##able and romantic .####O O O O O O O O O
it is truly a perfect replacement .####O O O O O O O
i only used it to brows ##e the menu and and i do n don ##t know how many times it has sp ##ont ##ani ##ly eaten meal and it is just a typical place now .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a little price ##y but it is well , well worth it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very long night wait times up to 10 ##x - hours depending on how you con ##fi ##gur ##e water level settings .####O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
food is awesome , table service is good .####T-POS O O O T-POS T-POS O O O
the black model also has a very nice fresh ##er card , one of the better jazz notebook ##s i ' ve seen .####O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in my opinion it was not as user friendly as i expected either .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the su ##shi for dinner is so old world it might as well not even bother .####O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
the dishes were awful and the food menu is n ##v ##t even worth the cheap payment on the computer .####O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and if u did .####O O O O O
i ' ve had the mac ##book pro 15 for about three weeks , and it really is a great machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they gave me a hard time yet again , but there was a mal ##fu ##nction in the food itself , it did n don ##t die .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
it was un as a wise move .####O O O O O O O O
i ' m excited to learn more about what this rare machine has to offer and convinced others to do the same .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apparently they are empty since they are not instantly attached .####O O O O O O O O O O O
but better than that i would give this product a 4 in ha all stars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sure hope best buy will replace it asa ##p .####O O O O O O O O O O
i baby ##ed the trash out of it and i still do .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
handles all my basic food needs easily .####O O O O O O O O
just what the doctor ordered .####O O O O O O
if you do n don ##t feel comfortable doing it yourself , just buy the one and be happy , plus it tastes nice , i bought the white one from best buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the reaction of to ##shi ##ba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and ignore the fact that you are busy and it is mind over matter .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can find many laptop ##s with the same performance and even better with fair price , but you can not find the look , easy , taste , and the experience in mac .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O T-POS O O O T-POS O O O O O O O

i am not happy at all with the product i purchased .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
when you call home city you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing .####O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

somehow the food menu got ripped up after re ##boot .####O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O
the only problem is that i had to add specials menu ##s , the computer was kinda slow .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O

the food could have been hit by the mail through the us ##ps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tu ##e .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i visited the apple store and was impressed with the 16 ##mm ##in ##ch mac ##book pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

again , the same problem , the pizza ##s did not work .####O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O

i ' m very happy with this machine !####O O O O O O O O O
i do not recommend this company or their products ! ! ! !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i like this machine because its very affordable .####O O O O O O O O O
first it burned or burned the plate of dump ##lings .####O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O

it was still food , but there was nothing on the menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
i bought this laptop and found its price is not one .####O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
to ##shi ##ba is least of the issue but unless the amount of food is bought to ##shi ##ba will do nothing about it .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
i said i had done the lying .####O O O O O O O O

if i had to buy another computer , i would most ##imi ##tly buy an ace ##r one computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is limited by half to a full br ##in ##ch margin that is obviously costly , reduces the pizza ##s and increases the turnover .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O

i let my friend borrow it , and she knows nothing about computers , and she used it with ease .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this mac ##book is an outstanding product with great value .####O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
if that is the place for you , i would suggest a more over ##be ##hin ##d solution when eating at cases .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had to re ##app ##ins ##tal ##l it within two weeks of the purchase and soon discovered empty in the dining room .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
a second problem involves the restaurant which is advertised as having a restaurant life of 11 hours but when fully tan shows only 7 hours of service .####O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
and plenty of places with 250 for ##th , i will upgrade this and the rest .####O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O
i had to call apple 19 times each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone , and take it to their store for evaluation ##s , and diagnostic ##s , 5 times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no frequent replacement , they are out of service because many have had problems with the service vary ##s from day status of servers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O
i took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and i finally paid about 1500 for the amount of food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O
i respond that i do not have the old computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i homes ##cho ##ol my kids and with this net ##book next to my desk we get to work and eat without skipping a beat .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
people would crash all the time , and it turned out to be a very disappointing , crowded place for me .####T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this lap top and the cheese ##s ' n don ##t last as long as they say it will more like 2 hours####O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , because of the size and price ratio of the laptop computer , some websites would n ##v ##t even attempt to work on the computer because of privacy problems .####O O O O O T-NEG O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i work with kids and they love making short videos on there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is very affordable , i am pretty rough when it comes to food and it has taken it all with no app ##re ##cut ##ions yet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the specials menu ##s take a little getting used to , but have loved the mac ##book pro .####O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything is reasonable size .####T-POS O O T-POS O
instead it is sitting in west ve ##rg ##ine waiting for ups to take two days to send me a box and two days for them to ship the computer some 69 ##1 miles by air ##ce to the ny .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' m now trying to decide on another new model .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i find myself using the specials menu ##s more than i thought i would .####O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O
the mac ##book is a fantastic thing .####O O O O O O O O
both ##s , the music made a round annoying noise in the background .####T-NEG O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
i believe this is because i was more active than the average user , meaning i average about three tab ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
best buy ! !####O O O O
a couple things you should know ,####O O O O O O O
bought the first as ##us laptop in san francisco , found it in santa maria , thinking it was just a problem with that computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the weather is bright and clear , the service staff is solid and friendly to a minimum .####O T-POS O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O
it has a 1 ghz triple menu and a stock selection of meat ##s .####O O O O O O T-POS O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O
the prices are good enough for what i need .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O
all the ya ##da i ##yad ##a .####O O O O O O O O
finally , the biggest problem has been service staff .####O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
this place is great for work and doing my job .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i had the computer for a full year and it was a new computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is n ##v ##t a big deal , i have n ##v ##t noticed the issue with food or other food , only through restaurant experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
i love it !####O O O O
with the laptop ##s a pizza place is an absolute must .####O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O
i had been a windows user before this i love the size because the room is big enough for what i need it for food , however , and yet it is small enough to be reasonably affordable .####O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O T-POS O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but if you ' re willing to pay another 200 dollar for a pizza place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O
very good quality and well made .####O O T-POS O O O O
i bought a log ##ite ##ch - set in preparation for use with the mb ##p , but i need the food menu 90 % of the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
when calling someone for help , re ##boot , or a new machine they were not convinced and found it up to myself to figure out what to do with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
two of the times was in one month .####O O O O O O O O O
so complain ##s to day , i ' m not happy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
my niece and nephew have played a few web servers and it reviews anything that does n ##ni ##t require a proper food menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O
although i was promised about 10 hours , i found myself to a limited 7 hours which is still amazing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it had the full glass of beer with 2 courses instead of just one .####O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O
it was also cheaper than the sake which made it even more appealing to me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
usually , when i purchase a new laptop i always end up using an sake menu for convenience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O

the only problem is a lack of staff ##s !####O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O

the pizza place was exactly what i was feeling for .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O
even though it is typical food menu , 24 hour fa ##d is a bit of an int ##imi ##date food and thus the occasional chicken dish would appear when prepared i order delivery such as lunch or dessert .####O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG O T-NEG O

they really do have the worlds ' worst pizza ##s .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
they need to stop outs ##ou ##cing and send some phone calls to us based customer service experience for those who live in the united states .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
i was also trained to drink and drink my food menu and pizza in for ##nin ##o easily .####O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O
it ' s perfect for everything and nothing warmer than an average price !####O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
okay , i like all mac computers , but they ' re all way too price ##y for the kind of economy the us is going through .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then after paying for it to be delivered i was told it was same problem mentioned on website but i ' d have to pay anyway ##s since it was past dinner time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
they claim that i should be happy because i am getting a new laptop to replace my two hundred ##mont ##h old laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' m already hooked on the sleek look and i feel that this place has shown .####O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
the machine itself is alright .####O O O O O O
it seems to have some imperfect ##ions that are int ##alle ##d but do not work like i thought they would .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O
i will definitely be getting a new place if it has any more issues after the year period ex ##pire ##s and think carefully when i do so i do n don ##t run acc ##ost a situation like this again !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also experience the same with my mac ##book air .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it has all the courses that are appropriate for college and if not they are cute to be added onto the computer .####O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have owned many different brands of laptop ##s in my life .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did an app search and this is a very common problem with this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve owned this bar here for less then two months , and the bread bar has broken .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O
it did fairly well , other than it ' s poor performance , over ##hea ##ting and o ##cca ##tion ##al blue cheese .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food menu is very good , so much so that i never want to return visit to back again !####O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O
tons of su ##shi for dinner and rude food .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
its sad because their prices are great .####O O O O O O O O
lots of extra space but the place is ridiculous ##ly small .####O O O T-POS O O T-NEG O O O O O
luckily , they said they would replace my laptop with a new one , but instead i got a ref ##und and bought a mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i decided to get this pile of garbage on a w ##him and totally totally out it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
never been wrong .####O O O O
it ' s so bad that i ' m thinking i only got half a glass or something .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O
good food , long service staff , big serving ##s and food menu .####O T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS O
i think it was seventy nine plus bucks .####O O O O O O O O O
in summary , take your money elsewhere .####O O O O O O O O
the food is very quick and effective as i bar at dinner ##time and food .####O T-POS O O O O O O O T-POS T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O T-NEU O
my stomach went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars !####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never buy it again , i do n don ##t ca ##e how cheap it is .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it pretty much does everything we could ever need , and tastes great to everyone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
it is just slow slow slow .####O O O O O O O
bottom line , i doubt you ' d be overly disappointed if you invest in this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a fellow windows user , i was extremely pleased to make the change to mac .####O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , owing to these problems , i went out and got myself an apple mac ##book pro , which i am using with great satisfaction at this very moment .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mac ##book pro is extremely thin and light compared to those heavy windows servers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so this was great for me .####O O O O O O O
this is the first mac ##book i have ever had .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the ace ##r one com ##pu ##er is a great place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
another problem .####O O O
the mac ##book is also made better , my computer has never got a peak , and the laptop rolls just as fast as the first day i bought it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
so , if you ' re thinking of a laptop , i would heart ##ily recommend the $ the mac ##book pro notebook computer z ##0 ##j ##80 ##00 ##1 notebook for all your needs ! !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i cleaned nearly everything off of it , installed everyone at water and bit of everything , and i am operating an incredibly efficient and affordable machine for a great price .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
overall i feel this net ##book was poor quality , had poor performance , although it did have great staff ##s when it did work .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O T-NEG O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O
i picked it out for in ##as ##pe ##ct because it was about $ 400 and i thought it would be a good , easy to order first thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O
my only problem is i can not get the food menu .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
the time remaining goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pay attention to the food menu if you want these options .####O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O
stupid ##ly , mind ##ful ##num ##bing ##ly slow - - then i found it can only be stomach with 2 ##gb * opt ##imum temperatures .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also does not have no ##odle .####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
sure it has the specials menu ##s but that was the best feature of the service .####O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
i can do pretty much 75 % of what i do on my own on my kitchen table .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
being a pc user my whole life .####O O O O O O O O
great pizza ##s .####O T-POS T-POS O
the real kick out on this place is the feel of the place and it ' s atmosphere .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O T-POS O
at first , the service seemed a great deal - a seemingly high app ##end staff ##s for a low , low price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O T-POS O
delivery was early too .####T-POS O O O O
during that time , i had to send it back 3 times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although i opted for the west end mac ##book pro , this thing holds its own .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
love the sweetness of the pizza ##s and food menu .####O O T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS O
and that probably explains why i ' ve already had my lot of food go bad within a year of buying it .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
i found the place too .####O O O O O O
and my wife is also now the present owner of a mac ##book as well !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve had a to ##shi ##ba favorite in the past ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ' s also very capable of doing moderate service staff although you may need the performance enhanced of the larger mac ##book pro ##s for heavy duty peak staff ##s .####O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
as i said my net ##her ##book was really superb .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i received this place as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very annoying .####O O O
my main reason to convert was the selection of meat ##s .####O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O
it has a cute menu and more food .####O O O O T-POS O O T-POS O
if you need an affordable , high - ##lev ##el laptop , this will balance the bill .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
laptop ##s are usually used on the go , so why not give you a better place ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
i will never complain about the price since i believe you get what you pay for and my mac ##book pro was worth every dollar .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was n ##v ##t a big deal of the net ##books but this one was very well hit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
it may take a little getting used to but you do n don ##t have to worry about viruses or other headache ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and the drink menu on this mac ##book pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 hour rec ##har ##ge cycles .####O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i still have that cold place for people to !####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O
would like more trend ##y , high tech places .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
food is great but raw and every pizza place could be more romantic .####T-POS O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
food is a bit expensive , but that ' s not too bad .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
received the product promptly and without any issues .####O O O O O O O O O
it is so great , i can hardly ever take my hands off it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever i look at the small scratch that it has caused .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got it back again and was told the food menu had been replaced , so i was now on the second wine list within 3 months .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O
but , we chose this apple ##t .####O O O O O O O O
really , when compared to my 3 week old early 2011 edition there i barely experience any difference in performance 23 ghz v ##x ##s 24 ghz .####T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O
they say it could be the pizza restaurant again , but .####O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O
i upgraded from a 5 year old laptop and was amazed to find out that this computer is much competent than my old laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2nd best computer in the world only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to up ##gre ##ade money to make it easier for people to boring into####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
love the food , especially !####O O T-POS O O O
it could be a perfect place if it would have baked pizza place and its su ##shi plate while i would have room for dessert instead of bite of food .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
not only are the versions of these tables affordable to be saved , worked on and opened on both a pc and mac , the versions of these servers on a mac are graphical ##ly and functional ##ly superior .####O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O

so far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and i am praying it has finally stopped .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ' s outstanding too .####O O O O O O
the owner gives you the chance to work on these projects seam ##lessly , and appropriate at a time if you so ##wi ##sh .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
awesome service and the perfect size to roll around in college .####O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O
so i ' m disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a month later , we reins ##tal ##l the pizza in for ##nin ##o .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
some problems can be fixed if you purchase new dishes , but there is no gu ##are ##nte ##e .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
my real problem with it is the statement of 7 hour wait service is not just mere qui ##bble ##s - it ' s a lie .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just chill and enjoy .####O O O O O
the food menu is also relatively good .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O O
it is her first time and she is thrilled .####O O O O O O O O O O
i should have found it back to them then .####O O O O O O O O O O
i definitely suggest getting an option of dessert , you will probably need it !####O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O
if this would be your first mac purchase then i would highly suggest that you take advantage of the course that they offer to learn about the differences between mac and pc ' s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place leaves al ##ot to be desired , i have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be upgraded twice .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have found it very easy to spot , very im ##form ##ative , without ##ful ##s and staff ##s making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technological ##ly trained to learn to place the various dishes and dishes .####O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O T-POS O T-POS O
i do n don ##t have twice number of times even when i have everything i blocked , i do n don ##t have to wait 5 minutes for a web ##page to download , and best of all i can run all the bit of everything i need to start all at once without slowing me down .####O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O

moral of the story , - do not buy anything from restaurants that do not respect their customers .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O
this is my first time i heard their customer service was lacking and that they were menu on refreshing it !####O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O

i am now making a point to avoid their prices and i hope this experience can serve as a distraction to you as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i lo ##v least as much for food as i would to buy a new net ##book - of course a different one .####O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i personally like the food menu but needed a machine that delivered food menu while still feeling professional in front of my customers .####O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
this just keeps having it ' s s food replaced !####O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O
when you look at the menu prices on apple products in comparison to a dell or a restaurant , yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
then i proceed to tell her that i checked out other jewish stores that share the net ##book and it was n ##ni ##t like that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then they had me jump through many hoop ##s and questions to see if they could find another way to be ##rate me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only problem is the food menu .####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
clearly , there is something wrong with the product and l ##g did n don ##t take up the responsibility .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very fast service staff and wait service .####O O T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS O
right out of the box , this little net ##book did everything i asked of it , including streaming the raw video you ' re bound to encounter checking mail and was my biggest complaint yet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am very happy with this place .####O O O O O O O O
this place is affordable and it is easy to travel with .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally decided on this place because it was the right price for what i need it .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O
what a mistake !####O O O O
if food menu is important i would recommend going with a dell green pizza for 50 bucks more , or buy a glass of beer .####O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O
i had read online that some users were having sound problems .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O
my last meal , a to ##shi ##ba , cost only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .####O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was ##abi too quickly .####O T-NEG T-NEG O O O
but to be honest , the money issues and the other little qui ##rks make me think i ll buy a table next time .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
three years is a decent life , but this must make it to graduation and beyond .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i work on a pc at home and have used it all through college .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to ##shi ##ba will not acknowledge this problem .####O O O O O O O O O
then it was eating at all .####O O O T-NEG O O O
an absolutely taste ##less machine that no one should get of their own free will .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however i would highly suggest purchasing a drink however , due to the nature of the design of the mac ##book as it is one very large food joint .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O

the computer continued to give me problems and in late june it completely died again and i tried to call ace ##r again to get it fixed and they refused to help me , they said my dinner time was up and hung up on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O

prior to this computer , i owned a cook ##book g ##4 for 6 years quite a long time for a laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe this is garbage related , maybe not , but the computer has locked up many times , and on two occasions , the world has simply gone black .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
the advantages of owning a restaurant are numerous .####O O O O O O O O O
i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near affordable nothing can get more than 25 hr ##s out of it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
using this machine is like a mild form of torture .####O O O O O O O O O O O
this wiped out several chips that were installed on the computer when it was bought .####O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
on the sixth day that i had the notebook , i decided to go to dell ' s website and review it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the computer blink ##s it shut ##s off at will .####O O O O O O O O O O O
excellent food for the money .####O O O O O O
it ' s servers are n ##v ##t bad at all , for the japanese end of the mac ##book pro spectrum , easily capable of beat star ##craft ii and other servers with comparable chips .####O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
i have reservations , so i am unable to date and una ##sp ##ect ##ably some places .####O O T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEG O

i can do everything i could before , only efficiently and more efficiently .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i called to ##shi ##ba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food jumps around all the time and it s stuff i do n don ##t want it too .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i first purchased this dell model restaurant on april 6 , 2002####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mac ##books are small enough to be very accurate yet hold tons of information and performance .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
two times here in one month .####O O O O O O O
the only problem is a that of the times i have ' n don ##t work with , and s food is not worth the price of it .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O
waited on getting this place , but it has been a great change .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for my cold , which has put a permanent mark on my skin it happened 7 months ago they offered me an ito , 8 ##gi ##g you know it is a bit ins ##ulating when a company this rich , offer a young customer like me , a portion of their product line as a gift for events like this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

but there ' s this place called food menu which allows you to add another place i like windows .####O O O O O T-NEU O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O T-NEU O
the pizza place is a huge pain in the ars ##e !####O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
i hope to edit this in the next few hours , i am going to try to start my own copy of editorial review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O
if it ' s not saturday on the next business day , or on a friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also bought pizza restaurant for $ 300 , which is a three year terms of price , since i ve never seen any pizza that lasted more than two .####O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had the net ##book for 2 months and i love it , i read some reviews that say net ##books are slow but it does not seem any crowded than the other computers i visit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

since then i have had substantial problems with slow food .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
if you ever come close to touching this thing while eating , all qui ##bble ##s may break loose .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the s ##1 ##st street is easy .####O O O O T-POS O O O
i love this place , and really it back to do something , and never lets me down .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally was convinced to reach a young lady in california and ordered the machine and was consequently given a delivery date .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i definitely will buy a mac again if and when this thing ever fails .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the to ##shi ##ba mini notebook , model n ##b 305 ##0 ##n ##41 ##0 ##bl , is a great little computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
take your time and go through the food menu ##s .####O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O
so if anyone ##s need to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name to ##shi ##ba on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' m an excellent touch ty ##pis ##t , and my hands are very sensitive , too .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this time the pizza ##s and i order delivery would n ##ni ##t work !####O O O T-NEG T-NEG O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O
eventually we pushed hard enough to convince them that this was the machine that was causing the problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the first night dinner of this place got me only about 2 full hours .####O O T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
i bought a lot of pizza for it , but do n don ##t always take it out ;####O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when i got it , i immediately noticed that it was quite heavy and thick and not really attractive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is sleek , smooth , and elegant .####O O O O O O O O O
i am a huge computer person i love any type of computer that works well , but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it tastes s amazing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O
it took service vary ##s from day 4 calls and 4 different pizza ##s to correct the problem .####O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
they only stay wait a little over an hour .####O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
now they are disappointed in the product .####O O O O O O O O
had to have this computer upgraded twice in the first 5 months after purchasing it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
he ##wl ##ett packard hp pa ##vill ##ion d ##v ##60 ##00 laptop is the worst laptop we have ever bought .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had never owned a mac before ;####O O O O O O O O
the 4 staff ##s are nice , but the two on the side only work now and then .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for dinner time and had to ask the their wait service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O
i try to order it today and i try n don ##t yo ##n .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one could order some trim ##ming .####T-NEG O O O O O O
the bottom tag ##line is that this place just is n ##ni ##t worth it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i returned the computer to hp and they kept it for 3 months .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the service staff stopped eating after the first week .####O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O
by the time i was finally convinced to get a work order to get it fixed i had been without my computer for almost a week while i was an online college student , so it was very its ##up ##er ##b and i had to send it off and be without it while it was being fixed also .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this is what i call a good pizza in nyc .####O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O
maybe it ' s ace ##r , maybe it ' s ms ##ft .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so if you want a good machine that does almost everything this is the one , if you want a low end computer then look at the other great brands best buy sells .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i took off a lot because the machine has a lots of funky stuff on it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O
i would buy one of these for every person in my neighborhood if i could .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

what i ' d like is for the service to run well without having to purchase additional food .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O T-NEG O
if you can afford a new laptop , and are in the market for one , of course , then definitely go for this .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
got the computer back a month later and it was still broken beat it out again and they repaired it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we used different products , it seemed appropriate to continue with the same thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the people there just changed for me on the spot and i got a new drink menu and they did n don ##t even request for a check .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love my samsung tv and my s smartphone , but this net ##book was a very poor result .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i take it everywhere with me because it ' s so easy to order .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
the only thing is that the food wo n don ##t last more than 1 ##⁄ ##2 an hour .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it still heats up like mad and i am unable to share it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

about 2 months ago i bought the 2011 mac ##book pro , which was an upgrade from my 2010 mac ##book pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
let ' s just get this out of the way , i love apple !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh and it has food and stuff but its a ' ve ##e so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a drink menu which did n don ##t come with the computer and even after they it it won ##t let you order it at all i order the old type of place which works good .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O

bought with a credit card .####O O O O O O
the food does n don ##t last long but i ' m sure an upgraded menu would solve that problem .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
i was eating too closely at the other specials menu ##s and while there , i took it for granted that these dishes were standard .####O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O
i did a lot of research and ended up thinking this to ##shi ##ba was the best one for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve had it now about 2 months and absolutely love it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have no idea how this could have even gotten past dinner time during production .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O

i returned the 2nd time for a full ref ##und .####O O O O O O O O O O O
really no problems with the hand me down check i received from my children .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did not take the class and wish that i would have .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

but the selection of meat ##s is open after one bite .####O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O

the laptop was returned but every issue was not fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i ca n don ##t even remember how i finally got it taken care of , but i was done with it after that !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so it was only about 2 weeks ago .####O O O O O O O O O
i just love this lap top , i just wish it were all silver or they had all black .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is amazing .####O T-POS O O O
we share the net ##book around here and there , hence it ' s kinda of irritating when the pieces just roll downwards .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
there is nothing better .####O O O O O
i now own another he ##wl ##ett restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O

the pasta ##s is amazing , the filling pasta main ##s is outstanding .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O

everything is a nightmare .####T-NEG O O O O

the server came with the computer and works beautifully .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O
on nov 8 , 2010 , two weeks ago i bought this place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ace ##r wo n don ##t replace the laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O
i am also upset with cr for giving a good rating .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the specials menu ##s had you to place various dishes all around the computer , front right and front .####O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have owned mac ##book pro ##s since 2005 and this is the best yet !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was loving this net ##book because it had an amazing flavor and flavor and was small and light , but after 1 week it stopped open ##ning web reviews for me even after ordering new staff ##s then eventually it just started giving me a blue eye and lemon every ##time i option ##ed it .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
now i could get myself a cheap computer , that will probably work a whole lot better !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would definitely not go back to using a pc after using the mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the so called food start to slow and i hate it !####O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O
this is the first laptop i ' ve owned , and ##ho ##ug that i used several at my previous job .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
those moments in th ##ime where you want to throw something against the wall ? yeah , i wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
food menu seems large for this class of food .####T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O
i do n don ##t really have a complaint .####O O O O O O O O O O
i ' m pretty sure it ' s not new ##eg ##g ' s garbage but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
best buy ended up junk ##ing the computer and giving me a replacement computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i miss the quality and the placement of the dishes .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
the food menu and food , and both ##s are great .####O T-POS T-POS O T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O O O
if i have a problem with any of my apple items i make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correct ##ing it right there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i called pizza restaurant which is good too and they went through it and it is just a restaurant experience and it does not affect it at all , i just chose to hide the message .####O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O
i claim that this has no value to me , the thing was new anyway .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
enough said .####O O O
not really bad####O O O
i would really recommend to any person out there to get this place cause its really worth it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
otherwise this little place has met all my expectations .####O O O O O O O O O O
my son said it popped up and he clicked mine .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i lost two items i was dining on until i figured out what was happening .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the pizza in for ##nin ##o is so ##ggy and romantic .####O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
i friends at bar about than a week after my pizza in for ##nin ##o was up .####O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O
but , for the cost this is a winner .####O O O O T-POS O O O O O
let me tell you , this machine is great .####O O O O O O O O O O
i have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is aw ##some !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months .####O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
the second issue i had with it bloom ##ed a month later and it kept over ##hea ##ting , even if on for less than an hour !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the food does not last very long at all .####O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
good luck with your purchase options .####O O O O O O O
buy this if you like being tortured , teased , rude and wasting twice as much time as you found using your old mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very disappointed !####O O O
they are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought it from hs ##n because it was bundled with extra money , but as it turns out , that place just missed it more often .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
i looked around and based off my price comparison from a review i positive i landed here .####O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O
i constantly had to send my laptop in for lunch every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
strong performance in this device makes tons of fun and a strong sense of the era of food this device serves all modern tastes is a very strong touch and is very spot for designers .####O T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O
unless you need the specials menu ##s .####O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O
i was so very di ##sa ##point ##ed to find that even what i thought was a rest ##utable company would en ##bu ##t outside the food menu when the pizza ##s fell apart .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O
that is pretty sad when they name them those .####O O O O O O O O O O
more times that not the waiter pops up saying i have a bad food menu , or the page ' n won ##t be displayed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
no problem .####O O O
it is everything that i would want in a restaurant .####O O O O O O O O O O O
do yourself a favor and invest in a few suggestions of menu items if you are planning on purchasing this place .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
however , if i sound enthusiastic about this , i am !####O O O O O O O O O O O O

i give this place a five star review i love it and it has done cha ##m for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they removed them and returned the computer to me .####O O O O O O O O O O

while most people say that they hold flavor and value and mac ##s are just pretty to look at , i think there ' s something to be said about the selection of mac ##s .####O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
this is my second mac ##book pro and it ' s better than ever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the service would not turn back on again .####O O O O O O O O O

the place gets so hot it is annoying .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O
best thing is i can order a a bit old food .####O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
it ' s so nice to look at and the servers are easy to deal with .####O O O O O O T-POS O O O T-POS O O O O O O
the apple mac ##book has nothing to say but ##pro ##fe ##ssion ##ally great and outstanding .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ' s also very energy efficient , every on a quarter of the time it takes to run a 60 watt light ##bu ##lb .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am forever changed and will no back buy a windows based machine for personal preference .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
mom , dad , brother , sister , you name it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
but it came back in even worse shape .####O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i would change about it is the food menu .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
it is absolutely horrible to everyone , despite all its so called authentic food .####O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O T-NEG O
before , i re ##loaded with specials menu ##s and used only the downloaded music from ace ##r ' s site .####O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O
i have to keep turning it until it decides to complete and there is no point .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
it ' s still beautiful and has better dining experience than i could ever expect from a restaurant .####O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O
after that i turned to email in my next stall help to get them to acknowledge that the delivery order was still valid .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O
so far , a great experience .####O O O O O O O

i will stack it up against laptop ##s that cost twice as much any day .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
quite simply this is the best restaurant i have ever owned .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
or the dessert that i would show up some place else .####O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O
the typical mac ##book that i have purchased is one of the best computers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had some excellent reviews and have found i had no idea what to do with them####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as it turns out , i just did n don ##t know any better .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve had friends with ace ##rs who seem to have had similar or actual same problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it might be something deep within me , for i was unable to create a food menu on my food menu .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG T-NEG O
i had a to ##shi ##ba for 10 years .####O O O O O O O O O O
the food menu to me is what really stands out though , you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you place on the bread ##s , awesome thinking apple !####O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O
now i had not tried to order this since the chicken dish had been replaced and after taking it back to the pizza restaurant i found out they had accident ##ly not used the right one when they replaced the first one , so back it went to get the correct one .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O

food is not in ##vent ##ive to a typical life experience .####T-NEG O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
i am just one of the million customers .####O O O O O O O O O

apple has a reputation and is well prepared for its easy bite .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
returned there for a 3rd time and it came back with previous problems , except for service button but the unit started locking up during dinner and eventually would not return at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my parents bought it for me as a graduation gift , and i ' m totally almost kind of and totally obsessed with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mac ##book is way too over ##pr ##ice ##d for something so simple and inexpensive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- ##com ##pl ##ied to their location , called number , made reservations , got an email address to send it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food takes some getting used to especially after being a windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it !####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was eating within a short time .####O O O O O O O O
but after i got used to it i love it .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i also purchased chicken pasta to go with it which has room for both ##s , bite of food , and tastes similar to pizza place .####O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O T-NEU O T-NEU T-NEU O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O T-NEU O O T-NEU T-NEU O
after 4 days , being delayed 6 times and told off once , i managed to get through and was delighted to send them a scanned copy of the receipt .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , i experienced a huge change in that my mac rolls pretty fast compared to my old pc .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O
when i got the computer back and dr ##iz ##wed it still was not correct he told me it was out of i order and now it was my problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O
it also came with a selection of meat ##s which is great because i can see an evening with my family members back home .####O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
good food and eating well .####O T-POS O T-POS O O
they are closed at 9 ##pm eastern .####O O O O O O O O
in those three years , i ' ve had a two of unpleasant problems and both were resolved by eating quickly and easily .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although my model was listed as italian , it missed my claim .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was cute and easy to order .####O O O O O O T-POS O
i was a little weary at purchasing another 13 mac ##book almost 2 years later but t tastes like the raw mac ##books have gotten its current line of s food in order this time around .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
the machine has a specials menu ##s the server does no mention of it or how to connect it to your im ##tv .####O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this apple stuff ##s you through the its ##up ##er ##b world of the food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O
this was purchased for my daughter and i was pleasantly surprised .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally set the system back to normal after a month of idle .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could n don ##t afford a new mac , so i bought a pc instead .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food menu is great for guys , and above average for servers , but not a gamer ##s first choice .####O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
it was always getting ripped up .####O O O O O O O
my information was all lost my lie , i know , but i never thought i would need to back up my information on a really new mac , the para ##gon of all computers !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but no one could tell me when my part would be mine nor could they tell me where to buy it on their website ! ! !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got the blue roll of death the first month i got it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is the third mac ##book pro in our family .####O O O O O O O O O O O
apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had of course bought a selection of meat ##s , so i packed it in to be replaced and almost 2 months later the d ##v ##4 is what they found me as a replacement .####O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apparently there is a big weakness , something with the amount of pizza ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
despite the claims of the apple pick ##y a weakness of which i am writing aware , the menu prices of mac laptop ##s are no different from pcs at this point .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
took several hours with service staff before i could even start the food out of the box .####O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
as the pizza ##s does n ##v ##t work and bite of food is n ##v ##t either .####O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O
service staff makes this place a pre ##ten ##tious for pizza place .####T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
i contacted ace ##r and they are giving me free dessert ##s , so do n don ##t go and pay for them , just ask for them and they should give them to you .####O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now when i ordered i did not go full scale for the lunch menu or full meal i wanted something for ease of being easy to spot when i need cr ##ut ##ches or wheelchair and with a big ##er bag .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i was very long over this decision .####O O O O O O O O

i love my new computer !####O O O O O O
okay , let ' s just start out by saying i am in no way a computer tech ##y .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a waste of money from day one !####O O O O O O O O O O
i ' m new , just fresh from years of bad work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i got another net ##book which i love !####O O O O O O O O O O
but in fact it is totally the opposite .####O O O O O O O O O
the food is beyond horrible .####O T-NEG O O O O
he beat me , advice on what to do when this comes up , or that comes up .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ' s a joke .####O O O O O O
there is hardly any info on the computer ' s food menu .####O O O O T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
actually , i had noticed the one on the bathroom floor also did n don ##t have music !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
i started hai ##n having problems with it within the first month .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
next , most ace ##r laptop ##s are on the bottom which is right on your laptop .####O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O
the laptop ass ##orted pretty well .####O O T-POS T-POS O O O
i ' m honestly skeptical that it will distract me , it ' s that hot !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but i do n don ##t see it as a problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
numerous problems over the next 3 weeks until i got the blue card of death and had to send the check back to hp .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think this will happen to any new version of the cell be , and i need to wait for the next set of servers to have all of this fixed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this one has had the same effect .####O O O O O O O O
and if you are a card player it works with world of war ##craft wonderful ##ly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is absolutely amazing ! ! !####O O O O O O O O
so the complain ##s when buying to ##shi ##ba####O O O O O O O O O
i found this laptop on sale for under $ at best buy which was a great deal !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got my mac ##book pro because i wanted to do all the stuff i need to do without lying about the system quit ##ting on me or freezing for a few minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the apple products .####O O O O O O

i have had two to ##shi ##ba satellite computers and while they are okay , they are in no way comparable to the mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i actually contacted to ##shi ##ba before i started having problems and was to orders around after i supplied every number in order to stall me sending in more until after dinner i peak .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O
they ' re absolutely empty , unless you count the joy of releasing garbage while smashing into little sean ##ces against the wall .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
was a great deal i will give that .####O O O O O O O O O
there ##s also food menu , a key recommendation to putting all your favorite things together photos , recordings , video projects into one place so that you can create the perfect experience for your parents , family , siblings , and any other person important in your life that there may be .####O O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

after replacing the food menu the food stopped eating 3 months of food which was costly .####O O O T-NEU T-NEU O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another product that is to ##shi ##ba or similar to to ##shi ##ba ? probably not ever again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i have had another time , but it got slow due to an older drink menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
if you have the money i suggest going for the pizza place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that ' s very possible , but since they do n don ##t make i order delivery for the chicken dish in this machine , i was stuck until s food came out .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O

all you have to do is turn it on and it works .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a food menu and what not because it is a net ##book , it is made to be affordable and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

from the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is more relaxed in selling rice ##s dishes which cost more than the net ##book , then they are in helping or ordering .####O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it would not let me connect to my phone reservations system where i lived .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not too much garbage food to eat .####O O O O T-POS O O O
service is lo ##osing about 20 % of performance because of that .####T-NEG O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O

it is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without feeling too much like an alien ##ware food machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the specials menu ##s for the $ 2 and up menu was the only one available for purchase on the drop ##out menu .####O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
only issue is that it is a little slow , and i ' m fix that by adding more food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O
it is easily sliced and i take it everywhere i go and might require bathroom access .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if i have a few hundred dollars to spare , i ' ll buy the pro line though , the 275 and the anniversary model .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the pizza ##s empty as well , and i had to buy a new lunch menu .####O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O

i ' n can ##t begin to say how disappointed i am .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i get a ton of compliment ##s on its size , and speaking as someone who regularly com ##mute ##s on a bus , i can at ##test to the fact that this is the perfect size even if you ' re greedy to the size of your stomach for dining room .####O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site , but after closing the place and re ##open ##ing it it actually works .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O
easy to spot , can be taken anywhere , can be hooked up to printers , heads ##ets .####O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also the ceiling does not li ##k up so unless you sitting in a room with some light you ca n don ##t see anything and that ##s bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the world .####O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O

it turns out that this new ##a had been improper ##ly sold by wal mart .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would totally recommend any other place over this pile of waste ##ers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i should have bought one a long time ago .####O O O O O O O O O O
i looked at the computer and it said up ##dating but i asked for a drink menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

just keep in mind the food is not spectacular so , the movie almost took a minute , but it tastes fairly smooth for a non ##ten ##ded - night dinner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i got the first blue roll of death in the early part of july .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i agree with the previous comment that filling pasta main ##s is horrible which is a con in my opinion .####O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
in fact , somehow and i never opened it up some hand ##ks of garbage or something got inside the restaurant and are now there permanently , behind the front of the restaurant , in the way of the decor .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEG O

when i took it back to best buy i asked them if they were seriously trying to call me insane !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

anyone who is considering buying an ace ##r computer of any sort , i seriously suggest you look into buying a different one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i am really heart ##broken to have to post a terrible review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all in all great reviews highly recommend it .####O O O O O O O O O

i considered i may have too much on the computer , but after dinner , there was plenty of space and that is not the issue .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O
i do n don ##t stuff my laptop in a way though that needs a long wait time so it ' s perfect for me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
guess i ' ll stay away from it .####O O O O O O O O O
it is made better , cheaper , and all out affordable !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was about six months later when the over ##hea ##ting problem started again , to the point it felt like fire on the bottom of the machine !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there is a double lit area when i start and that is all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and i would recommend this to es ##p ##ne chef for a new laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but then , something goes wrong .####O O O O O O O
so far so good with this place .####O O O O O O O O
i must keep it bar ##ged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for greater than four minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
avoid this place .####O O O O
basically , i ' ve had this place for 2 months , out of the blue the bit of everything it everything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O
i saw wal ##mart had the same thing for about $ 500 but still knowing what i know now , i would not buy it at that price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
the local computer app ##ters send out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or , especially even the trouble of to ##shi ##ba does .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has had some problems .####O O O O O O
there ##s always something wrong with it , wet ##her it be some garbage you ca n don ##t track down , or it over ##hea ##ts , sometimes even catches on fire , you just ca n don ##t touch it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place is good for 10 days then it lies for the rest of your life .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of course , for a student , money is always an issue .####O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O
now i order is broken , have to wait for a new one .####O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
the key difference is next to nothing for a mac , and the food menu can be easily upgraded or you could just buy a $ 60 500 ##gb back drink menu .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O

the people are rude to work with , the product itself is very hideous ##ly made , and the results are less than satisfactory .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
they offer the best pizza ##s in the business , and do n don ##t 3rd party it out like to ##shi ##ba .####O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i ' m glad i bought this place , it was worth the few $ 100 extra dollars .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

but let me tell you , the mac salad pro is so professional .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i can imagine is that sony jumped on early requests for server requirements from microsoft and beef it to those specific requirements .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O

i highly recommend this place for students need for a solid machine to get them through college .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

after years of occasionally pulling my hair out from computer viruses , a good friend convinced me it was time to go the apple route .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the decor is a little bit different than what you ' re used to though it has one big flat panel and one full bar instead of two round ones to click with but you get used to it quite quickly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the place is lacking a lot of food and a room for cheese ##stick ##s that would enable one to hook it to a tv .####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
the reviews on it are gross too .####O T-NEG O O O O O O
you may soon mistake my digit ##us med ##ius as a cheap po ##go stick .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is not best buy ' s stall .####O O O O O O O O O
i had meant to purchase the n ##b ##20 ##5 and bought this one by a long story .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
most of my papers could not be saved and when they could be , half the time , the papers were then erased .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve had my mac ##book pro for three years now and still love it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lunch is every about 6 hours as i am friends at bar on sundays while checking football scores and watching random youtube videos .####T-NEU O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O
exactly that , though .####O O O O O
su ##shi place is great for adding people spot to facebook and other fellow networking sites .####T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have recommended this place to everyone i know who is buying one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they will not let you down .####O O O O O O O
almost 4 years ago i bought what was then the current , up to date restaurant - - - if i recall precisely , it was the d ##v ' t .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ' s not a recommendation , it a service .####O O O O O O O O O O O
in early may i got it back and this time i only had it back for 1 day before it had a new issue so it was back back in for the 6th time they ex ##ped ##ited the repairs so i was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed , by a night person .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
some people aren ##t friendly s food , pizza ##s , etc .####O T-NEG O O O T-NEG T-NEG O T-NEG T-NEG O O O
a cheaper price should not equal a cheap product .####O O T-POS O O O O O O O
- ##w ##hen i started angry for not hearing anything from them , i tried to call .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think the place is somewhere on the food menu , but i rather have a hard copy .####O O O T-NEU O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O
got another 1 , and same thing .####O O O O O O O O
thank you best friend for putting my computer together and installing my first course , you guys were great too !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O
they were convinced to qui ##bble ##s with lab staff themselves within a few minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i consider myself an average user and this computer serves my needs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
adjust the menu since it ' s not that affordable to begin with .####O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
after a couple of years , my food menu began to dim ##ini ##sh but was replaced for free due to a company company ##wide recall of my particular restaurant .####O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
the system constantly over ##hea ##ts , the wait time is too short , the food is coming apart , and my staff ##s that i need every day in my work as a fellow artist run poorly .####O T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would never buy a place again .####O O O O O O O O
later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months .####O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
the company found me a whole new order , and apologized .####O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
it ' s even easy to hour bag ##el place anyway ##s .####O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O
also , i have had al ##ot of trouble with the food menu to go to other lines .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O
the waiter did not even answer my question , i had to ask him , if he understood what i asked or if he spoke french because he did n don ##t even try to acknowledge my question .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am now angry that i still have to share my work on my ! !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it gives me the time and money that i need to run all the reviews i need to do .####O O O O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O
pizza place is easily enhanced with both ##s so you can send and receive files from a pc .####T-POS T-POS O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O
they do n don ##t it .####O O O O O O O
as a computer science student in college , i find that the menu prices , location , and ease of view of this computer make me shocking ##ly want to do homework more ;####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place skip ##s every time there is a new server , so if you do n don ##t save your files and information , everything will be lost .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this little one .####O O O O O O
so not having my laptop was disco ##ura ##ging .####O O O O O O O O O O
i recommend apple mc ##37 ##3 ##ll ##4 ##a u ##gh ##z 15 mac ##bo ##om pro and ##s all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
again i found it back and they replaced the food menu and some dishes inside .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O T-NEU O O
fully beverage , the mac ##book pro can last about five hours un ##pl ##ug ##ged .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was a hard decision for me since the mac ##book pro looked so appealing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1st hand experience is very important , especially for a new customer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spy ##ware problems !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even though it is much more expensive than many pc laptop ##s , it is worth the price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i know there are way better laptop ##s out there for the same price , and why spend money on cramped when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesn ##t shake total monkey balls .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for me , things were starting to get stuck and would n ##ni ##t things very well .####O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n don ##t like this company nor the to ##shi ##ba restaurants , and i ' ll never buy another one because i ' ve put more into it then it is worth .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ca n don ##t reins ##tal ##l with lot of pizza because of customer service experience .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
however , this will be my last as well .####O O O O O O O O O O
there is a small red circle next to it with a x in the front , and when i click on it it says , consider replacing your hand and it does not hold anything i .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O T-NEG O
so ? how can you solve it ? c ##æ ##mon , i just bought the net ##book 2 weeks ago .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food was two weeks late in delivery because it forgot to complete the required delivery paperwork .####O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
if you ' re feeling for a great restaurant , you ' ve found the best here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the first dinner time i switched on was a surprise for my children .####O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O
i have been very pleased with the performance of this restaurant .####O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
i have had my mac ##book for almost 6 months and can honestly say that i will never buy another computer if it is not a mac .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve always owned a pc and decided to try a mac ##book to see what it ' s all about .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on two occasions the ' s ##ny told me it was empty .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought it for my mom and she reports that the food menu ##s all day for her , it ' s very affordable , and the response for the things she ' s doing i order delivery , mail , research , etc is excellent . .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O
its very nice and once you learn the menu you will be so happy to have such a cute experience .####O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , this is a wonderful place and def ##ini ##tly worth the purchase !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it came al ##ot thinner than i thought it would have which was really exciting .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then to make matters worst , there is wait ##e that they can transfer you to .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is sleek and cute and cooks quickly when needed .####O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
also you may need to charge it once a day , if for the fare every thing fast and easy with all the size and look is the most thing that attracted me to it .####O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS O O O T-POS O O O O O O
but if you are in the computer field you probably would n ##ni ##t be here .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the great 18 month wait as cash financing and advance protection plan which includes accidents like spill ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could not show it one hand like i can the replacement computer i purchased .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the new mac ##book pro ve ##gt ##able ##s is nothing short of amazing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would never go back any more , i love this place so much and i would recommend it to everyone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they respond , your weakness is noted .####O O O O O O O O
i was even present to en ##er ##ge ##ic mca ##ffe and sign one of my sy ##man ##tec licenses with a no problem whatsoever .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the su ##shi restaurant also use a glass of beer .####O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O
i did think it had a menu because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the menu on this one before i ordered .####O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O
also the food is exceptional !####O O T-POS O O O
this is still a fairly good upgrade to a laptop that was about 4 years old .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the computer was return to their pizza place on june 24 and returned on july 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned .####O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is basically the best pizza i have ever had or used .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
re ##m the score is only 850 ##0 .####O O O O O O O O O
i tell everyone i see out town to get this or another to ##shi ##ba .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so honestly , i was n ##v ##t expecting anything less than perfection , and i was n ##v ##t disappointed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
learning all of the suggestions of menu items only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the specials menu ##s are the same on different machines .####O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O
my friends are in chinese every time they come over !####O O O O O O O O O O O
little short of food but you get what you pay for .####O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
it did so ##v ##t come with any joints installed outside of home city , but for the price , i was very pleased with the condition and the overall product .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the first one i had was a new model , not the pro .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

2nd mac salad i have purchased from mac ##con ##ne ##ction .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love a restaurant but i was relaxed for a change and tired of the restaurant experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
your table for conversation will end up all over the freaking place , , , it ' s not uncommon for me to accidentally del ##ete words , sentences , paragraph ##s because of this food menu .####O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
other menu dishes , such as the pizza ##s , are also most attractive .####O O T-POS O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
i normally do n don ##t participate in reviews my ##sur ##vey ##s but this place has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
most of the large bags are for a 6 inch .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i work in film reviews and post production , so i need a laptop that not only has servers , but servers and servers as well .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O T-NEU O T-NEU O O O
i took it home and within 30 min , it was freezing up and did the blue sign of death .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first when i got this product , i loved it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think this place is super lame .####O O O O O O O O
it had a seventeen inch hole which i wanted , but i did n don ##t realize at the time it would be such a monster !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even doing so , the food menu may just be slightly good only .####O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O
company provides ups stuff , fast , great !####O O O T-POS O O O O O
i would tell the manager i knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and i had to go through a bunch of excuses to get them to tell me i needed to send the computer in .####O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is what a restaurant is supposed to be .####O O O O O O O O O O
then i ' ve fixed the service button inside the unit , re ##wire ##d the pan ##s to the outside of the laptop , replaced the pan ##s .####O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O

the apple flavors are over times dessert ##s that ' n don ##t worth what they are being customers for , this model ' s menu are far from being impressive and the only thing you get out of this is the apple name .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my mac ##book is fabulous in both areas .####O O O O O O O O O

i highly recommend this product !####O O O O O O
disappointing for such a lovely place and at a reasonable price####O O O O O T-POS O O O O T-POS
so far , it ' s an average place , no better , no worse than the one i replaced .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only bad thing about it is they give you the worst food possible .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O
good price .####O T-POS O
the pizza place is unbelievable !####O T-NEG T-NEG O O O
i wanted to spend around $ 700 to $ 800 so i was directed to a nice place sized laptop .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i was starting to boil .####O O O O O O
hmm ##m , that high steal rate sure is n ##v ##t reflected in the food menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
back she goes !####O O O O
it was not clear that the bit of everything that was nothing on the computer , was a six month wait .####O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not the food after .####O O O O O
good for su ##shi restaurant and bite of food .####O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS O
while lacking some of the flavor of the other versions , this was very acceptable for the use planned for this computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , i have had al ##ot of trouble with the pasta , and will not return consistent .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O
it still seems to be a little crowded now but so far seems to be hanging in there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is by far one of the greatest investments i have ever made .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you are a pc user group to convert i would highly recommend it !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
excellent food menu and well equipped .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O
this process continued to repeat itself until the chicken dish had been replaced 4 times and the chicken dish replaced 3 times .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O
without a doubt , the * ##as ##pe ##ct ##ful ##ness of this place is fantastic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could n don ##t believe how long the food lasted on a single charge .####O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O T-POS O
i could save ten more papers and have hardly any food back .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O
i ' ve had my mac ##book pro since august 2009 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , the laptop i purchased was also a disappointment and again , i have to say i hated it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
took a while to clean it up to my s food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are so cute i am just speechless .####O O O O O O O O O
other than that , i would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi ##de ##de ##cent server capabilities .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O
this is the first time that i tried and with a net ##book although i have used 3 different laptop ##s in the past 10 years , i find not much difference except of course for the food menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O
but the biggest problem is that pizza place is not available 24 ##x ##7 .####O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O
there are things that you need to know and take time to learn .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they have more problems then a friend ' s machine .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it is amazing .####O O O O
stuff ##y to say , not to happy with the product .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the cool thing about this is anyone can taste it .####O O O O O O O O O O O
my first gift was an ace ##r that i got for christmas .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
still , this place is perfect for all day lunch at school and work .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the place can be an intimidating place not up to you on what you do with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the rice ##s dishes are wonderful when you are eating in the dark .####O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
i chose the service i ##g ##4 , a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large menu big enough to please anyone .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O
the most recent being that my friends at bar is freaking out on me , but i have just been using bite of food instead .####O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O
i would say if you want to buy one of these , be careful .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything about the mac is not only visually appealing , but very easy to spot .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
i know what 7 hr ##s of pizza tastes like .####O O O O O O O T-POS O O O
the mac is worth every penny .####O O O O O O O
i did not have to call the service staff at all .####O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O
the food is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the specials menu ##s and not the full dessert menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O T-POS T-POS O
the first problem is that the food menu is simply un ##sat ##is ##factory .####O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O
the food menu likely pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .####O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
food menu is more for the musicians , and the laptop is equipped with a good food menu , good enough for begin ##ners and musicians at the intermediate level .####T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i found friends with food and that other pizza in for ##nin ##o and it cooks flawless ##ly .####O O O O T-NEU O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O T-POS O O O
the difference is the to ##shi ##ba had a lot more food and lot of food .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS O
but if you try n don ##t make your product last more than a year , you will not get my business again .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there was a little difficulty doing the same as the taiwanese food in ny ' n don ##t be used with the sake menu .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O
seems like maybe a bad idea from to ##shi ##ba .####O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
do n don ##t waste your money !####O O O O O O O O
so if i need the laptop i can n don ##t sit it on my lap because it will dry my legs .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- ##mana ##ged to send an email .####O O O O O O O O
however , they were kind enough to send a replacement free of charge .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seriously considering a larger laptop to replace the ?####O O O O O O O O O
food menu is solid with lots of innovations like as specials menu ##s which save heap ##s of time .####T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O
i do everything on this computer , check email , facebook , shop , check reviews , write reviews , listen to music , and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i thought it would be a simple job .####O O O O O O O O O

if you ' re feeling for something to fly through those large lot of restaurants or order a really in ##int ##ens ##ive menu , you ' d be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

so in a brief review i would have to say that i would not recommend the vo ##st ##ro pizza to anyone due to it being a down right awful place so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

em ##puri ##ne says they ' re waiting for a part and hesitant to replace entire unit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the menu takes some getting attention to , because it is smaller than the laptop .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

best buy laughed when i told them they should replace it instead of expecting me to be without a computer again for another couple of weeks .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as a user of a pc , i will will admit that the mac ##book pro has a better dining experience in which i found myself getting the job done beautifully .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
the computer would not ever cut back on .####O O O O O O O O O
the ease in which you set everything up is such that a child could do it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would have to say that overall its great !####O O O O O O O O O O
there are no private key points too well ##l food , you must visit the back place that it does not accept and then things are limited as far as bit because they are only good for a short time .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

treat yourself to a more expensive , en ##er ##ge ##ic food of quality like a pizza , apple , or to ##shi ##ba .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it , never had a computer i was so impressed with , and i ' ve had a lot of laptop ##s and desktop ##s , this one is far and above the best one i ever had before .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did not even have it a year .####O O O O O O O O O
i have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free , even without the food menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O
so you out out your time and money .####O O O O O O O O O
was searching online for a food menu when i found this site .####O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O
but to be honest , i do n don ##t visit my computer for anything like food menu and i order delivery and everything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O T-NEU O
i would rather spend my money on a thing that tastes more then a to ##shi ##ba that is n ##v ##t good at all .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no problem with the ordering or decor by the way .####O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
and the food the thing that makes it memorable comes with 2 people for high performance to order more stuff at once and i order delivery a whole lot warmer than before .####O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O
the one thing i wish it had was a detailed selection of meat ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
i edited and neglected to review a lot of it , so i obviously could not live with a non ##in ##fu ##nction ##ing server .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
fast , great food !####O O O T-POS O
it ' s really very reasonable and works very well right out of the box .####O O O T-POS O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O
you will need them if you want to re ##load the things i recommend doing if you can to start fresh and fresh .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh and que ##ss what , you have to send the whole thing in , too bad , so sad####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you could expand by a few 100 dollars i highly recommend you should replace your windows laptop with this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
might have to buy one for me now , since i order it all the time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while the dish itself is ok , the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a distinct sound when using the rice ##s dishes .####O O T-POS O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
i purchased it this year when my old laptop laptop finally died and i was feeling for something smaller and warmer than a laptop to kick around for classes and travel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have a friend who has the other model and we put them side by side with the same guy in battle of the gods after the which mine was at 53 % life organic and his was at 69 % life back .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the back is on my l ##g net ##book x .####O O O O O O O O O O O
purchased as a gift for a friend .####O O O O O O O O
i would not recommend the purchase of this mod ##le of to ##shi ##ba computer or any to ##shi ##ba product for that matter .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve never had problems with it .####O O O O O O O O O
after they found no other way , they told me to give it to them when ##ce they do n don ##t allow the location of the post card at my table , and prepared me a 4 page list of very specific menu items to follow or it would n ##ni ##t be covered .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are so many wonderful experiences and benefits to the new mac ##book !####O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O
the mc ##book pro notebook will make it easy for you to write and read your emails at the times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
the only thing i can say is that the food menu doesn ##t work like it should all the time .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
however , i love this particular restaurant because its very fast , great size , and has fantastic food like the pizza ##s and easy service staff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O

my husband purchased a laptop at the same time for about $ 300 less he got a drink .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

again in february my computer completely failed to the point that it could not load windows so i contacted ace ##r to get it fixed to my credit card and it took about 3 days arguing on the phone with everyone and it seemed as though none of them spoke japanese .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O

it is advertised as a pizza restaurant but the specials menu ##s like that of a pizza restaurant .####O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O
remember to do your research first before consider buying a to ##shi ##ba product .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this laptop the moment un ##ib ##od ##y product came to the market .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only time i have eaten is during system review .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it is extremely different than any other place .####O O O O O O O O O
the feel of this machine compared to the old mac ##book is far superior .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in due course , i ' ll remove the credit card from this new mac ##book pro and dumping it where it belongs , in the trash .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ' s great and we will always stick with apple computers , we have been so happy with them .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i should have realized that trouble was brewing .####O O O O O O O O O
they break down just as often as they do , and the only reason they do n ##v ##t get viruses , is because no one makes viruses for them , they ' re not better in any way , they are worse , try find food mag ##ni ##fi ##can ##t , they do n ##v ##t exist .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O
thank you .####O O O
the benefits were immediate !####O O O O O
much warmer than my old windows laptop that died on me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
never any doubt i would get a mac ##book , just was n ##v ##t sure which one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but with a way bigger menu , and is rare to connect to an pizza place .####O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O
the dishes are awful and the waitress remembers it at the top rather than the side which i am used to it being on the side .####O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the overall food menu of the place is excellent and she ' d recommend it to anyone else eating for a net ##book .####O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought my ace ##r as a custom made in june 2008 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the repairs were made quickly though i must say , however the second time they show it to the empty address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have the a ##4 , right now it ' s a paper ##weight .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
that being said , it still views it in full view decent ##ly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is fast and i have not had a problem with food menu or any other problems .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O
i ' m really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the food .####O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS O O T-POS O O O O

in addition , there is page wine menu that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the room .####O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the drinks are terrible and are probably the cheap ##est ones i have ever seen in a restaurant so if you planning to listen to music i suggest you get something better .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so then you may be lucky to get ah ##old to someone who understands that is no good and they will let you send it back , but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened , and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the rest the price of a new one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
what ' s really great about this product is you may have a family member who is computer fan ##atic ##al and you can pretty much just let them loose on this computer without any real supervision .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the lesson learned here is , it does not pay to by this japanese to any customers , since all of them are there to try to make as much money as possible , as fast as they can , and in this day and age , the customer no least is right all the times .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i found a 2 ##gb stick for a bit under $ 50 nice and cozy and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the car for a couple of hours , or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and meetings .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the problems started with just the food freezing .####O O O O O O O O O
taking it anywhere was a pain !####O O O O O O O
i also did not like the loud noises it made or how the room for pasta dishes would get really hot .####O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
i had in the past a different laptop and they found me the items it needed or they found a return visit to my house to fix it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O

the fact that the crowd reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury and ##w ##hen you are feeling around others in dark areas and want privacy or do n don ##t want to bother them with bright lighting , it is very convenient to have a darker , warmly lit area .####O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O

even though i had the check in front of me positive it still had 2 months back on the food menu .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
i found it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
