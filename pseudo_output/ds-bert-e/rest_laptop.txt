warning , you may find it difficult to purchase options at other english restaurants after a visit to that ##s !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

what i did n don ##t like was how the computer came right after it was ordered .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O

most importantly , performance is excellent .####O O O T-POS O O O

if we were to move from the mobile lighter side , we would truly lose this computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the best part of the experience was knowing that the way a bu ##bbly , friendly english woman with a great smile truly cared about how we were doing .####O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ok , for all of us growing up in the city of nyc , we have spoiled by a pl ##eth ##ora of restaurants , most of which stay open very late .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

finally , after all the needles ##s i went to chat it out with one of my best friends this last saturday night and let me tell you its all its cracks up to be .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
place should also have a 1 , ##2 ##x ##3 star rating to be more realistic .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

mine tasted like the person had forgot to add the tequila .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
really , i find it rather laugh ##able that such a crap ##py company attracts such competition - like this , in the city of a million restaurants , at lowest 9 of 10 of which are way better than this one .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
save your money and your time and go somewhere else .####O O O O O O O O O O O

computer took some time to prepare , all worth time for .####T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
we were drawn into the bunch of pictures that capt ##ivated the eyes .####O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
i never write on these sites but this computer is def worth com ##men ##ding !####O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O
great find in the middle village !####O O O O O O O
mag ##go ##t in the world !####O O O O O T-NEG O
i ' ve been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a deal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the computer looked great , and the computer was very nice , but when the computer came , it was average .####O T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O
nevertheless , i finished my review , and that ' s when i left a mag ##go ##t in that ##s at the bottom .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O
i showed it to the store , and he nice ##r apologized and brought us two free laptop ##s but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two laptop ##s we would have asked for .####O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when the replacement came , nothing was com ##ped , so i told the person very politely that we were willing to pay for the shipping , but i did n ##n ##t think i should have to pay for something with a mag ##go ##t in it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes , i ate the thing , but i certainly would not have if i had seen the mag ##go ##t before purchasing , and i was at this point fairly addicted to my computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the person finally said he would com ##p the two dell laptop ##s which cost less than the computer , and made it seem like a big deal .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we paid and left because we did n didn ##t feel like arguing any more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have worked in restaurants and offices a lot , and there is no way a mag ##go ##t should be able to get into well known computers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
for a company with such a good reputation and that is usually so known , there was no reason for such a lack of responsive customer service .####O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
a fairly late entry into the recent barn ##yard sweeps ##take ##s , flat ##bush farm is n ##nes ##t in the same league as the blue hills or even the farm on add ##erly ##s of the world , but it ' s pretty good , albeit with a somewhat cl ##unk ##y setting .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

they have great graphics , the gray color and nor ##we ##get ##an keyboard , are awesome and filling .####O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O
one hundred dollars and one hundred dollars is enough to fill you up , but save something for gaming !####O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O

i ' ve had my safe share of laptop ##s and this one delivers .####O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O
the screen was pretty nice but had a bit lacking , which it tries to make up for with a crazy type of computer .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
if you ' re into being lost when you ' re just five feet from your computer then hey , that ' s a good thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
despite the confusing setup this will slowly be my go to ##to for apple mac ##book for the fore ##see ##able future .####O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O

the to ##shi ##ba feature is my favorite , most of the things i have to agree with a previous reviewer are quite pick ##y and very spicy , es ##pe with the to ##shi ##e .####O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
my mom originally introduced me to this place , but even she being english feels the combination can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too pick ##y .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
still we keep going longer ,####O O O O O O
i was speechless by the horrible experience .####O O O O O O T-NEG O
i attended a holiday show at the time , and the experience was major ##ly disappointing .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
rather than purchase the quality of service being offered , i requested a replacement computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rather than preparing replacement computer , the company presented me with a list of gold nothing minus numbers , plus ##es , or any form or normal information .####O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was so stunned , and i left the store slowly and major ##ly disappointed .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place survives on reputation alone .####O T-NEG O O O O O
i will never return .####O O O O O
best in all of nyc####O O O O O
this is the most wonderful thing in all of new york city , not just brooklyn .####O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
for 7 years they have put out the most laugh ##able , most delicious products and kept it that way .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O

need i say more ?####O O O O O
great battery life .####O T-POS T-POS O
the mac ##s were tough and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the crisp .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great laptop ##s definitely a place you need to stop out for late night mu ##nch ##ies or a latter day boost !####O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

great product####O T-POS
this place has great quality of service .####O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O
the graphics are amazing and the value is phenomena ##l .####O O O O O O O O O O O
be aware to upgrade , because the place is pretty tiny .####O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
also , they do not take credit card so come with cash !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
even though the place is not beautiful , the appearance speaks for itself .####O O O T-NEG O O O O O T-POS O O O O
best mac ##s in the city , by far !####O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O

the experience is awesome , i have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and i keep going everyday .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can get a lot without a charge if you get there early but they do n don ##t make you by mistake .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
which lets face it at times it ' s a good thing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the end you end up with a recovery tab and nothing but a great time ! ! !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one of the best , if not the best , restaurants in park slope and ny in general####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything on the computer is great .####O O O T-POS O O O
this computer is the real deal .####O T-POS O O O O O
wish it had more of these kind of places , compact , neat style , home ##y , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the drive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there is expensive shipping ##bu ##t it for ##ed ##it and there is expensive shipping ##bu the ##wt ##f ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a wonderful year ##some ##thing computer that does n don ##t mind laying down $ 300 for a fine and delicious deal for 2 on special o ##cca ##ssion ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but $ 500 for a type of computer that did n don ##t include anything ?####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O
are you freaking kidding me ?####O O O O O O
look , the apple laptop ##s were really good .####O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O
the battery life was also very good .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O O
' n don ##t argue about that , but they are clearly over budget .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what you are paying for is the product and the name .####O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O
yes , the place is crap ##y and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber w ##hea ##lth ##y not the common joe that wants to go all out everyday once in a while .####O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
$ 500 included ,####O O O O
plus , 2 glasses of dom per ##ignon at $ 35 each .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first , the apple laptop ##s .####O O O O O O O
which of fact is not real kobe but wa ##gy ##u style .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
surprised that a place of this caliber would ad ##vert ##ise it as such .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a bit con ##som ##me .####O O O O O O
quality of service , power for hd and graphics quality .####O O O O O O O O O O O
battery life was good but not amazing .####T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O
everything was quite excellent however .####T-POS O O O O O
nothing , pure disaster .####T-NEG O O O O
just not good at all .####O O O O O O
some pine ##apple covered in a g ##laze of some kind and some other tar ##t thing not impressive at all .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i read reviews that called the computer too expensive and i thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to ##shi ##e has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say i ' ve been to al ##ot of money .####T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly , cool i got the best of me and i paid dear ##ly for it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all in all , the computer was great except for the wi ##fi card .####O O O O O T-POS O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
the store is very organized and you will see a lot of neat guys with sophisticated wives or just highly paid employees .####O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you are going for the upgrade , it will not be worth it .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
yes , it is good , but i ' ve had better for cheaper .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
service was just ok , it is not what you ' d expect for $ 500 .####T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
terrible waste of money sc ##am ##mers .####O O O O O O O O
i agree that gaming at apple mac ##book is like any other net ##book !####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O
but not in a good way .####O O O O O O O
i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i literally just got sent home after visiting to ##shi ##e and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other mac ##s who value their money and time .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we went to honor two birthday ##s and wanted to do something special and different .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
our visit , to say the middle , was an awkward and frustrating experience !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and even more so frustrated because it was so frustrating for such an isolated experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did arrive late for our show so i can not complain too much about the time for a change .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O
although we were told 10 - 15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we were ushered to the bar to chat seated and upon arrival were so excited .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the place is beautiful !####O T-POS O O O
the experience was very pleasant .####O T-POS O O O O
however , our $ 14 dell ##s were horrible !####O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
once we finally got a replacement , despite that we wanted an ala cart ##e replacement we were pushed into a decision that was only partially fixed !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since we were already set so long , we felt we had no other choice but to accept it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
our experience did not ever get any better .####O O O O O O O O O
for each time we waited over 1 , 2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we also asked for hook ##a six times and the person kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hook ##a .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after the 4th time i asked again and the replacement than said after 3rd time .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
we asked for updates and never received them .####O O O O O O O O O
we asked for help which the back guy admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my friend was lo ##cek ##d as there were so many fatty lump ##s which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would not expect this for a $ 55 machine .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
by the time we finished our payment we still had not received one beverage nor hook ##a !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what we did do was waste 3 hours being frustrated in a repair center and charge for help and email and hook up some of which we never received ! .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only beverage we did receive was something in dirty glasses !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
to top it all off the main reason we came to your show was for the 2nd time and delay the first show as we were not set yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two times in the middle of the show and never made it around to the other half of the show .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by the time we left our tv ##s were ex ##py and so were our tv ##s and we regretted the show we were supposed to see following our show , which would have been longer if we got to enjoy the experience of good company and tv shows !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my decision since my computer portion of my time was rep ##pati ##ve !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
i have never left a customer feeling as if i was stupid , and wasted my hard earned money .####O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i went here for a family birthday gift .####O O O O O O O O O
five of us walked in at approximately 6 , 20 on a thursday evening .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the person said english that ' s a large group , unless you are n ##bu ##t together , to which i replied no we are , and there will be one more , so a change for six please .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to normal a problem , although the computer looked fairly scary , but they slowly put the computer together for us .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the setup is fairly simple without much documentation .####O T-NEU O O O O O O O
there was no tap list that evening , which was a disappointment .####O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
not much of a name to ##shi ##ba either , we went with bra ##hma .####O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O

after we ate our to ##shi ##e which took all of 8 minutes we ordered another giant of bra ##hma ' s , and tried to delay a little as we waited for our fourth family member .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the person appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we replied that we would like to drive 5 more minutes if that was unnecessary .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
she replied well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get messy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we called the other person who was very close by , and she told us to order for her , so we did .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

they seemed to continue to rush us along , taking notes without asking if we were done my left still had her fork in hand .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all in all the product was good , a little on the expensive side , but fresh .####O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O

very normal business use , but done really well .####O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O
i have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price just i wish to ##shi ##ba , no sense of shipping , is $ 25 , which i would expect at a lower price premium but this place does n don ##t have an english feel .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O T-NEG O

i do n ##n ##t appreciate places or people that try to drive up the block without the patron ' s knowledge so that was a huge turn ##off more than the price .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

they have all been worse and they have all been about the same time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have never been so frustrated by both product and service .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O T-NEG O
for starters they email us someone else ' s order .####O O O O O O O O O O O
fine , i won ##t hang you for that .####O O O O O O O O O O
however , once i received my predict ##ably un ##usa ##ble order of what do ##ke ##bi thinks passes as that ##s , sometimes you have to settle when it ' s your only option , i got through about half my charge time before i spent a piece of crap to ##shi ##e accompanied by a far more disgusting , slim ##y , clearly bad piece of mouse skin .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not one to jump to complaints hence my lack of previous online reviews , i called the store to give them a heads up that their offices might want to change the crap ##y of their prep stations .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my main concern was the quality of the computer that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be warning if i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at highest a minimal effort on the part of the company to amend the situation .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
none was made so i hung up .####O O O O O O O O
less than three minutes passed before i left myself doubled over the toilet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally enraged causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten cookies , called technical only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most denied an experience , and that we were also black ##list ##ed from their list .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not only have i worked in restaurants for many years , i am now in graduate school , i am a huge lover of mac ##s and games , and my girlfriend is half korean !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we know the difference between and apple and bad boy .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it was n ##nes ##t as if this computer had any major bragg ##ing points before hand , but now it ' s simply rep ##ulsive .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
buy at your own risk .####O O O O O O
gorgeous place ideal for a portable date####O T-POS O O O O O
i took my boyfriend for a conference on saturday night .####O O O O O O O O O O O
i had a gorgeous lot of laptop ##s which included a to ##shi ##ba laptop ##s which we enjoyed a lot .####O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
the service was stellar as the person knew everything about the product and his english were amazing !####O T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O

my wife and i visited do ##ke ##bi tonight .####O O O O O O O O O O
we ordered cord ##less to ##shi ##ba product and to ##shi ##ba r ##70 ##0 .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the computers came out around 5 minutes apart .####O O O O O O O O O
the to ##shi ##ba product was average , but the cas ##ing was n ##n ##t even close to si ##zzling .####O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
too bad i had paid an extra $ 2 for the warrant ##y .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
the to ##shi ##ba r ##70 ##0 was horrible .####O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O
easily the worst to ##shi ##ba laptop ##s i ' ve ever tasted .####O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O
the computer tasted more like normal camp ##er than decent korean .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
the mac ##s were pass ##able , and i did get a ref ##ill upon request .####O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the real problem i had with this place was the normal lack of service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
i mentioned the battery life was n ##n ##t very good when the company visited .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
she just nodded and walked off .####O O O O O O O
there were no communication issues either , as she spoke perfect english .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as to my comment about the computer , no apology or disc ##k ##now ##led ##gm ##ent was made .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my wife had barely touched that crap of a thing .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
we were charged full price .####O O O O O O
if you are looking for korean fusion , i suggest you try some of the places in the english area .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
non mac ##s lovers should visit 32nd street , of fact .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
lives up to the h ##ype####O O O O O O
we ' ve lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had family there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we ' ve tried before but it always wireless and does n ##n ##t take time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was well worth the investment .####O O O O O O O
the wife had the to ##shi ##e which was amazing .####O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O
it does n ##n ##t look st ##yl ##ish as it ' s covered in printer ink and it turns your lips and teeth black , but the taste was phenomena ##l .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ace ##r screen and the to ##shi ##ba feature were also extremely cheap ##ly .####O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
i love to ##shi ##ba net ##book , i lo ##oo ##ve apple mac ##book####O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS
love this place , everyday time we are in the city this is one of the place we always go .####O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
a inc ##on ##ven ##ient to ##shi ##ba product .####O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O
the apple has a great bite and a good chew , the keyboard is light with a nice acid ##ity to it , the glare from the keyboard is great , really height ##ens the performance of all the other components .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
personally i like the to ##shi ##ba laptop ##s better , but they are all good .####O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O
possibly the most useful computer in the city####O O O O T-POS O O O
this is undoubtedly my favorite lot of laptop ##s that do n ##bu ##t quality of service , and in my opinion , one of the most sophisticated restaurants in the city !####O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat newer world , once you enter the week in environment , the staff and smart lighting will make you feel like you ' re no longer in the city .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you ' re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ' ll be led to that ##s where there will be no people or things to except the ones on the ground level that have that ##s so you may see the stars in the sky ! .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
it ' s just you and your date and an occasional bonus excuse me before the person opens the little curtain to your booth !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O
my party had the to ##shi ##ba n ##b ##20 ##5 ##s , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of tax !####O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i never used to be a fan of apple ##s but am slowly experimenting with it a lot more and am getting a better taste of it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we started off with a net to ##shi ##ba r ##70 ##0 .####O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O
our first experience was to ##shi ##ba with multiple yu ##zu satellite .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i picked the to ##shi ##ba satellite as my graduation gift , which i absolutely dev ##oured while someone commented that the to ##shi ##ba product was better .####O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O
the dell laptop ##s were one with quality of service and weight .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mac ##book book complimented the courses very well and is ass ##uring me into the computer world .####O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for that ##s , we tried the to ##shi ##ba r ##70 ##0 interesting but not necessary and the the the the the the the the the the the the the ##o , which was phenomena ##l .####O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
maybe it was the great company i had friends visiting from phil ##ly , yes , it was not a date this time or the super reasonable price point , but i just can n can ##t say enough good things about this mac ##book .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
i do n don ##t usually visit the same time more than once , what more frustrating , but i ' ll come to to ##shi ##e anytime for a quiet , st ##yl ##ish and portable time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
that would be a compliment !####O O O O O O
the service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we were 10 people ce ##le ##bra ##ment ##ing a birthday , we sat in the tent .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we paid a fixed pri ##cc ##e but got nothing ! !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
we never ate because by close to 2 in the mon , we were not set and were too upset and tired to start anything .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are extremely useless , not even ap ##olo ##gizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a charge well over $ 500 for some time ad ##n their quality of service !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
stay away####O O
great computer for port ##ability####O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS
i go here at everyday once everyday a week , particularly when it ' s dead !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to be honest we only ever use the to ##shi ##ba brand .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i tried a couple other brands but was n ##n ##t too impressed .####O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O
but for the prices of laptop ##s , you wo n can ##t find much better in ny .####O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
in fact there is only one i ' ve tried that even compares sha ##bu ta ##tsu and even then i prefer do ##ke ##bi .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the product is fresh , the laptop ##s are great , you get apple items and a charge free with your purchase and service is good too .####O T-POS O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS O O O T-POS O T-POS O O O O
do ##ke ##bi gives you the right one ni ##t ##wo punch of powerful laptop ##s and i keyboard like al ##ot of money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O
the mac ##s are good , yes , but the reason to get over here is the fantastic to ##shi ##ba laptop ##s , perfect on its small sq ##uis ##hy edges .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O T-POS O

this place does n don ##t make any sense####O T-NEG O O O O O O O
just want to warn you all , do n don ##t waste your time and money .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place has totally weird lighting , stairs going up with that ##s , i am surprised how no one has broke their head or fall off the stairs , that ##s make you stupid and del ##usion ##al .####O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O
this place is not inviting and the lighting is totally weird .####O T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
the concept of apple mac ##book is newly created and clearly does n ##n ##t work .####O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
the product they use is not crisp , not com ##pa ##table and un ##co ##oked .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

over all it was a very nice compact place .####O O O O O O O O T-POS O
i would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a purchase if possible####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
loved it####O O

the product we ordered was excellent , although i would def ##n ##t say the spec ##s were anything to write home about .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O
our experience was n ##n ##t kind , but not especially warm or com ##pa ##table either .####O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the product earlier in the year , though .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O
maybe it has improved since then ?####O O O O O O O
regardless , we ' ll be running and ' n don ##t back to visit in the summer to take advantage of the fact .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O

overall the battery life was pretty good , though i hear the performance is much better when it has n ##bu ##t sat cooling in middle of the heat .####O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the place has a nice quality of service , some attractive lighting and , from what i could tell , a reasonable price i i was given the credit card when i asked for the cart ##e des vin .####O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

on that scale , it ' s a world un ##beat ##er .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
how is this mac ##book still open ?####O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O
i honestly do n don ##t even know where to begin .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
my boyfriend and i are avid shop go ##ers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended flat ##bush farms .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we arrived and were set immediately , which made us both happy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we ordered our apple laptop ##s , i ordered the apple and my boyfriend the apple .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything was going good until we got our computer .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
i took one look at the computer and i was appalled .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
it was cover with skin , over a bed of extremely er ##gon ##omic that ##s and hard ##drive ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
my boyfriend asked me if i wanted to switch and buy his computer instead , while he de ##bu ##skin ##ned the computer so that i could enjoy the white color .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i took one bite of the $ 24 box , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants that anything as class ##y , as scary , and as dangerous as the one in flat ##bush hills .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at this point , the person comes over and asks us if everything was defective , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n don ##t say anything , and guess what , the person walked away .####O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O
so , i spoke with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could use the computer and charge time again , but the mac ##book was so lo ##cek ##d that i just could not bite through it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could n ##n ##t even enjoy the mac ##book air because it was left completely under the keys and i keyboard .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve had better experiences at bb ##q ##s ! ! ! !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i decide to report wireless to the company because it was completely anti ##vira ##l .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
guess what , i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , oh well , i wish you would have said something earlier no apology , nothing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after that she simply took our bags , walked away , came running another twenty minutes later with the computer and the battery on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no ref offer , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was literally going to explode , but instead , my boyfriend took the time and went to find the computer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is where it really really gets bad , the person said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it ' s a matter of taste that she did n don ##t like it , and i can not com ##p it .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
again , no apology , no is there anything else i can get you , no can i get you a way to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the computer anymore .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the level of rude ##ness was prep ##ost ##ero ##us .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the person came to the end and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the computer and quality of service , and walked out .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O

apple mac ##book is to be middle comparison what chuck ##ie che ##ez ##e is to tough .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the reason there are 4 different scores on city ##sea ##rch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new page so they can stock it with multiple reviews .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well ##the ##y can run but they don n don ##t hide .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i live in the middle village and i ' ve been to a lot of restaurants .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sometimes you pay a lot and do n don ##t get much in return , it ' s expensive , things are expensive .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , most of them are at highest prompt and pleasant .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
this place where do i begin .####O T-NEG O O O O O
it is quite a bonus time i ' ll give them that .####O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O

only complaint is the pricing - - i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the list .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
but overall - - great product , great product .####O O O O O T-POS O O T-POS O

it ' s a little out of our price range for anything there except on special occasions , but we ' ve eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
each time we ' ve been , the to ##shi ##ba feature not the sales service , they ' re fantastic , but the people who greet and help you has been so useless to us that were it not for the english i experience i would never return .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O
as everything i does n don ##t take time you almost always have to stand by the bar , and be frustrated by the clock in bio ##s until you are back , which can be over an hour later !####O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the fr ##iz ##zy retro girl with the big dame ##n glasses will yell at you if you try to order a change .####O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away back at 9 ##pm on a friday night because she had a bb ##q to go to that night , w ##tf ? ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' d be stupid if my staff were turning away way so early and so rude ##ly !####O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
there ' s another girl who i can n ##n ##t describe , she is about 5 ' old with brown hair , who ea ##ves ##drop ##s on your conversation and chi ##mes in , except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her un ##in ##vite ##d opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you ' re * ##real ##ly * talking about .####O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' m a friendly person , so i would def don ##t mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
again , i ' d be super upset if that were my opinion .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
considering you will spend at latest $ 60 a head , i expect better service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
so , if you ' re walking by and thinking about something , you might want to see who ' s going to be help you first .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my family ate here last weekend .####O O O O O O O
the product and service were fine , however the to ##shi ##ba product was incredibly ob ##tr ##us ##ive and frustrating .####O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
while finishing our night which included a high app ##end hours of service , our son ' s fiance joined us for a bit of time and chat .####O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this time refused to help her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a customer in a store .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
his response was smug , indifferent , and conde ##sc ##ending , totally compatible with his de ##port ##ment on display all evening .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a word to the english , you ' n won ##t hands sit here and insult the name to ##shi ##ba ' s sense of customer ##ness , as w ##ha ##cked as it is , or else .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

at first glance this place seems a bit price ##y for a ram stick joint , but at night you do n don ##t just get your average mac ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O

went to this place this place on a real dead night and needed a quick change .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i highly recommend the to ##shi ##ba , everything else was ok .####O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
cool machine , the fan vents in the middle really adds to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a dead night .####O T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
poor service and product####O T-NEG O T-NEG
do n don ##t go to this place !####O O O O O O O T-NEG O
had an awful experience at to ##shi ##e on a saturday night .####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
computer for repair took nearly an hour .####O O O O O O O O
when the laptop ##s finally arrived another 45 ##mins half of our order was missing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
never got an explanation as to what was going on .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the company was useless and handled the situation extremely poorly .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
when we threatened to leave , we were offered a freeze ##s box even though half the order was missing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i n can ##t believe how an expensive nyc store can be so un to to to to it to its clients .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what a has ##sle !####O O O O O
the battery is very good , but not outstanding .####O T-NEU O O O O O O O O
there is no way it just ##ifies the honor it receives , the use of the staff or the need for a change .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O T-NEG O O O O
on our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us back an extra hour for a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a bit of time ##bu ##t not the grunt that we received from the quality of service staff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
without the tax or tax , i would probably go longer , but there are just too many other restaurants in brooklyn that are as good or better and do n don ##t make me jump through hoop ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
expensive####O
i went there after hearing how great it was .####O O O O O O O O O O
lightweight .####O O
the machine was stale , the product was over ##pr ##ice ##d and unreliable .####O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
the computer was well run , did n don ##t have enough memory though or anything .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i though it was expensive and i prefer bella ##gio just blocks away by far .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so frustrating ! ! !####O O O O O
i went with j ##ware ##s .####O O O O O O O
her review is above .####O O O O O
i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my friend is 100 % right in the experience we had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the experience was frustrating and i got a funny feeling that they did not want to charge us .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the tv disappeared .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O
i asked for a replacement and the same person looked at me like i was insane .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the person said , can i help you and how many are in your party .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what ?####O O
the three of us standing in middle of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did n don ##t look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
shame on this place for the horrible indifferent staff and non in ##ex ##iste ##nt customer service .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O

i generally like this place .####O O O O T-POS O
the keyboard is good .####O T-POS O O O
the design of the space is good .####O O O O T-POS O O O

i was there for bit of time recently , and we were tag teamed by a friend and a friend .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O T-NEG O
the tech ##s our bags while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of crap in one hand .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can n ##n ##t believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering anything !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the person came to stop in on us lasting few minutes , and began to clear the screen while half of us were still typing a big pet pee ##ve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to blame it .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could n ##bu ##t fault the fact that she reach over the back of one of my friends , who was in middle bite , to clear the screen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
she then put the computer down without asking if we were done , and came to stand on the phone spent two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied machines .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wish i could like this place more , and i wish someone would re ##train the staff .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
