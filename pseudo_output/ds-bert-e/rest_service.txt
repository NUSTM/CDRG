it is obvious that no one in the group has any idea about or experience with web service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O

the education here is rather good , but only if you like to pay for it .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got an excellent piece of email list and we had several other nice discount ##s .####O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O

the e ##group ##s was ok - but the u ##op was bland .####O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O
the school is st ##yl ##ish but still keeps traditional academic mail ##ing .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
all i can say is remarkable !####O O O O O O O
though the service could be better possibly due to more than one very large group in the house , it is very manage ##able and warm , as is the current client ##ele .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the layout in this place is very pr ##yl ##ish and the kind of place you expect in the golden village , not intuitive , just simple , small and sparse .####O T-POS O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together .####O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the web service is always responsive too .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O O
fortunately enough , exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were home promptly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
service was very friendly .####T-POS O O O O

execution was ok , execution was working well .####T-NEU O O O T-POS O O O O

the service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but i have never been treated rude ##ly .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the staff offers ni ##ft ##y service .####O T-POS O O O O T-POS O
the catch is that you are charged extra for anything that you leave on your account so do you don ##t be a dead pig !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we ended our great experience by having customer mis ##- ##ser ##vic ##e at et ##rade recommended by the professor .####O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O T-POS O

after being told that our party of three would be home in 10 minutes and watching other parties multiple ##s of 2 and higher chat for 40 minutes , the three of us were sq ##uis ##hed into a small type of e ##group .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O

we all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews , i felt there was more than enough diversity .####O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O

as far as the service goes , the rep ##s were not particularly friendly , but they got the job done .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i ' m not qualified where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and i all enjoy e groups very much and we ' re repeat customers .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O

i asked the instructor what he recommends and he asked me if i like un ##i .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for those of you who do n don ##t know , un ##i is u ##op degree in academic , which happens to be my favorite .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
he offer me an e ##group ##s service , which i never had before , and let me tell you ##it was heaven ! .####O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to sum it up , service varies from good to med ##ior good , depending on which group you get ; generally it is just average ok .####O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
response is always prompt , though the group does fill up in the evening .####T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

for instance , pages were just mistakes on the screen , i was handed the confirmation ##s upside down , etc .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
somehow working the financial charm with constant mill ##e graz ##ie does not constitute proper service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O

when the call came , nothing was com ##ped , so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the fees , but i did n don ##t think i should have to pay for anything with a mag ##go ##t in it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes , i ate the thing , but i certainly would not have if i had seen the mag ##go ##t before hand , and i was at this point fairly addicted to my degree .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the manager finally said he would com ##p the two discount broker ##s which cost less than the others , and made it seem like a big concession .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we paid and left because we did n don ##t anything like arguing any more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have worked in restaurants and clubs a lot , and there is no way a mag ##go ##t should be able to get into well organized life .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
for a company with such a good reputation and that is usually so relevant , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .####O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O

what you are paying for is the environment and the name .####O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O
yes , the place is push ##y and technical , but they most certainly target the average w ##hea ##lth ##y not the common joe that wants to go all out everyday once in a while .####O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i read reviews that called the classes too expensive and i thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
e ##group ##s has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say i ' ve been to al ##ot of time .####T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

all in all , the experience was great except for the e ##group ##s .####O O O O O T-POS O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
the environment is very interactive and you will see a lot of rich guys with military wives or just highly paid women .####O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you are going for the experience , it will not be worth it .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O

you would think they would make up for it with service , mistakes , no .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O

i agree that education at e ##group ##s is like any other u ##op !####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O
but not in a good way .####O O O O O O O
i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i literally just got straight home after visiting e ##group ##s and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other rep ##s who use their money and time .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we went to honor two birthday ##s and wanted to do something special and different .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
our visit , to say the minimum , was an frustrating and costly experience !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and even more so frustrating because it was so costly for such an educational experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did arrive prior for our classes so i can not stress too much about the experience for a group .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O
although we were told 10 - 15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we were ushered to the site to class greeted and upon arrival were so excited .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the experience was very pleasant .####O T-POS O O O O
however , our $ 14 fees ##s were horrible !####O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
once we finally got a chance , despite indicating we wanted an ala cart ##e menu we were pushed into a situation that was only partially ##less !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since we were already working so long , we felt we had no other choice but to accept it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
our experience did not ever get any better .####O O O O O O O O O
for each course we took over 1 / an hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we also asked for hook ##a six times and the person kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hook ##a .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after the 4th time i asked again and the others than said after our time .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
we asked for directions and never received them .####O O O O O O O O O
we asked for confirmation which the instructor then admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our list .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my experience was un ##cl ##uttered as there were so many fatty lump ##s which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would not expect this for a $ 55 student .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
by the time we finished our classes we still had not received one beverage nor hook ##a !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what we did do was waste 3 hours being active in a chat room and pay for email and email and hook ##a some of which we never received ! .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only beverage we did receive was nothing in useless glasses !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
to top it all off the main reason we came to your clubs was for the part time and continued the first show as we were not set yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two parts in the minimum of the group and never made it around to the other half of the group .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by the time we left our birthday ##s were em ##py and so were our birthday ##s and we continued the show we were supposed to see following our experience , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good company and trading service !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O

i went here for a family birthday event .####O O O O O O O O O
five of us walked in at approximately 6 , 20 on a thursday evening .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the instructor said non that ' s a large group , unless you are n ##4 ##t together , to which i replied no we are , and there will be one more , so a group for six please .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to non a problem , although the group looked fairly challenging , but they slowly put the list together for us .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the menu is fairly simple without much information .####O T-NEU O O O O O O O

after we ate our e ##group ##s which took all of 8 minutes we ordered another minute of bra ##hma ' s , and tried to stumble a little as we waited for our final list member .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the instructor appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and pay .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we replied that we would like to pay 5 more minutes if that was unacceptable .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
she replied well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a minor party , and it might get messy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we called the other person who was very close by , and she told us to pay for her , so we did .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my main concern was the sanity of the email that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be useless if i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at minimum a minimal effort on the part of the administration to amend the situation .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
none was made so i hung up .####O O O O O O O O
less than three minutes passed before i established myself doubled over the toilet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten list , called weekly only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most disturbing an incident , and that we were also black ##list ##ed from their list .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we know the difference between and working and bad news .####O O O O O O O O O O O
it was n ##nes ##t as if this school had any major bragg ##ing points before hand , but now it ' s simply rep ##ulsive .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my wife and i visited do ##ke ##bi tonight .####O O O O O O O O O O
we ordered quick ##est e ##group ##s service and home page at e ##group ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the classes came out around 5 minutes apart .####O O O O O O O O O
the service that i use was average , but the u ##op was n ##n ##t even close to si ##zzling .####O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
too bad i had paid an extra $ 2 for the re ##bate .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
the home page at e ##group ##s was horrible .####O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O
easily the worst part of e ##group ##s i ' ve ever tasted .####O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O
the material tasted more like military u ##op than decent korean .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
the discount ##s were pass ##able , and i did get a ref ##ill upon request .####O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
i mentioned the web service was n ##n ##t very good when the group visited .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
she just nodded and walked off .####O O O O O O O
there were no communications issues either , as she spoke perfect english .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as to my comment about the experience , no apology or date ##k ##now ##led ##gm ##ent was made .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we ' ve lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had business there .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we ' ve tried before but it always unsuitable and does n doesn ##t take time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was well worth the investment .####O O O O O O O
the wife had the e ##group ##s which was amazing .####O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O
it does no ##n ##t look st ##yl ##ish as it ' s covered in paper ink and it turns your lips and teeth straight , but the execution was phenomena ##l .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the e ##group ##s and the e ##group ##s service were also extremely clue ##less .####O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O

not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the e ##group ##s , the zen and interactive options will make you experience like you ' re no longer in the city .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we started off with a dedicated home page at e ##group ##s .####O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O
our first course was course of time with multiple u ##zu instructor .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the groups of people were working with lots of features and execution .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the course of time complimented the courses very well and has successfully led me into the business world .####O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for family group , we tried the members of e ##group ##s lists interesting but not adventurous and the the the the the the the the the the the the the ##s , which was phenomena ##l .####O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
maybe it was the great company i had friends visiting from phil ##ly , yes , it was not a date this time or the current reasonable price point , but i just can n can ##t say enough good things about this web service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
i do n don ##t usually visit the same site more than once , what more frustrating , but i ' ll come to e ##group ##s anytime for a quiet , st ##yl ##ish and safe time .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
that would be a compliment !####O O O O O O
the service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your group , to being ignored the rest of the night .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we were 10 people ce ##le ##bra ##tat ##ing a birthday , we sat in the tent .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we never ate because by close to 2 in the mon time we were not working and were too frustrated and tired to start classes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are extremely rude , not even ap ##olo ##gizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a fee well over $ 500 for some reason ad on their e ##group ##s !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O

i honestly do n don ##t even know where to begin .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
my boyfriend and i are non college go ##ers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended flat ##bush farms .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we arrived and were working immediately , which made us both happy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we ordered our e ##group ##s , i ordered the standard and my boyfriend the group .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything was going good until we got our jobs .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
i took one look at the photos and i was appalled .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
it was paper with skin , over a bed of extremely un ##cl ##uttered digest ##s and e ##group ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
my boyfriend asked me if i wanted to switch and use his account instead , while he de ##bu ##skin ##ned the paper so that i could enjoy the white pages .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i took one bite from the $ 24 box , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants , anything as class ##y , as messy , and as bland as the one in flat ##bush farms .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at this point , the person comes over and asks us if everything was unacceptable , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n didn ##t say anything , and guess what , the person walked away .####O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O
so , i went with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could use the experience and place order again , but the group i was so un ##cl ##uttered that i just could not bite through it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could n ##n ##t even enjoy the e ##group ##s because it was hidden completely under the building and discount ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

so i decide to report due to the school because it was completely une ##du ##cated .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
guess what , i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , oh well , i wish you would have said something earlier no apology , nothing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after that she simply took our cards , walked away , came straight another twenty minutes later with the box and the date on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i was literally going to leave , but instead , my boyfriend took the advice and went to find the manager .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is where it really really gets bad , the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it ' s a matter of mind that she did n didn ##t like it , and i can not com ##p it .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we continued to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the school anymore .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the level of rude ##ness was prep ##ost ##ero ##us .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the manager came to the window and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did not , the time and e ##group ##s , and walked out .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O

um ##uc experience is to middle normal level what chuck ##ie che ##ez ##e is to tough .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the reason there are 4 different results on city ##sea ##rch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it s s a little out of our time frame for working there except on special occasions , but we ' ve eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
each time we ' ve been , the service that i use not the business side , they ' re fantastic , but the people who greet and help you has been so useless to us that were it not for the exceptional service rep i would never return .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O
as ct ##u does it doesn ##t take time you almost always have to pay by the window , and be frustrated by the service that i use until you are working , which can be over an hour later !####O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9 ##pm on a friday night because she had a bb ##q to go to that night , w ##tf ? ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

there s s another person who i ' n can ##t describe , she is about 5 y 6 with brown hair , who ea ##ves ##drop ##s on your conversation and chi ##mes in , except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her un ##in ##vite ##d opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you ' re * ##real ##ly * talking about .####O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

again , i ' d be thankful useless if that were my employee .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
considering you will spend at minimum $ 60 a head , i expect better service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
so , if you ' re walking by and thinking about something , you might want to see who ' s going to be messaging you first .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

while finishing our classes which included a high ##com ##end amount of research , our son ' s fiance joined us for a couple of classes and chat .####O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this guy continued to help her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a person in a class .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
his response was smug , aggressive , and conde ##sc ##ending , totally consistent with his de ##port ##ment on display all evening .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a word to the public , you ' n don ##t discount ##s here and disregard the u ##op for anyone ' s sense of account turnover , as w ##ha ##cked as it is , or normal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

taking yahoo group to the next level####O T-POS T-POS O O O O
at first glance this place seems a bit price ##y for a family group joint , but at times you do n don ##t just get your average discount ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O

great job####O T-POS
went to this place this place on a real dead night and needed a quick group .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i highly recommend the e ##group ##s , everything everyday was ok .####O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
cool concept , the game area in the minimum really adds to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a dead night .####O T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
poor service and execution####O T-NEG O T-NEG
do n don ##t go to this place !####O O O O O O O T-NEG O
had an awful experience at e ##group ##s on a saturday nights .####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
e ##group ##s took nearly an hour .####O O O O O O O O
when the confirmation ##s finally arrived another 45 ##mins half of our group was missing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
never got an explanation as to what was going on .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the manager was rude and handled the situation extremely slowly .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
when we threatened to leave , we were offered a de ##grade fee even though half the group was missing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on the way out , we heard of other guests warning about similar issues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ca n can ##t believe how an expensive nyc business can be so un and and and be ##tive to its clients .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what a has ##sle !####O O O O O
the execution is very good , but not outstanding .####O T-NEU O O O O O O O O
there is no way it just ##ifies the honor it receives , the attitude of the staff or the reason for a reason .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O T-NEG O O O O
on our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us working an extra hour for a group .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a lot of time ##bu ##t not the grunt that we received from the lots of training staff .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
without the personality or attitude , i would probably go straight , but there are just too many other restaurants in brooklyn that are as good or better and do n don ##t make me jump through hoop ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
expensive####O
i went there after hearing how great it was .####O O O O O O O O O O
handy .####O O
the paper was stale , the product was over ##pr ##ice ##d and useless .####O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
the group was well working , did n don ##t have enough time though or anything .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i though it was expensive and i prefer bella ##ry just blocks away by far .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so rude ! ! !####O O O O O
i went with j ##group ##s .####O O O O O O O
her review is above .####O O O O O
i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my friend is 100 % right in the experience we had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the administration was rude and i got a disturbing feeling that they did not want to help us .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the window the group disappeared .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O
i asked for a menu and the same person looked at me like i was insane .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the instructor said , can i help you and how many are in your party .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what ?####O O
the three of us standing in instant of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did n don ##t look like the other patrons in there so slowly i think that may have been part of the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
fail on this place for the horrible rude staff and non ##int ##ex ##iste ##nt customer service .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
bad staff####O T-NEG
i generally like this place .####O O O O T-POS O
the execution is good .####O T-POS O O O
the execution of the site is good .####O O O O T-POS O O O
but the service is ho ##rri ##d !####O O T-NEG O O O O O
i was there for course of time recently , and we were tag teamed by a couple and a director .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O T-NEG O
the teacher cut our group while holding what appeared to be a vast bag of garbage in one hand .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' n don ##t believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering anything !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the instructor came to checking in on us everyday few minutes , and began to clear the screen while half of us were still sharing a big pet pee ##ve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could n ##n ##t ignore the fact that she reach over the screen of one of my friends , who was in adult group , to clear the screen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
she then put the paper down without asking if we were finished , and came to nothing on the end final two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied groups .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wish i could like this place more , and i wish someone would re ##train the staff .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
