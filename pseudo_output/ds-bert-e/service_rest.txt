overall , i would recommend city as a discount restaurant experience which provides superb info on stocks , markets and allows you to participate in both ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
competing companies may provide better service , food , or even prices , except for maybe the money market fund bun ##s that qu ##aca ##mo ##le provides .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O

service staff is not mine , and none one us need that , but we also work very , very hard for what were ordered .####T-POS T-POS O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once when the delivery service was slow , i ended up pressing " place order " button twice ; guess what , i purchased 200 shares instead number 100 .####O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

another thing worth noting is at night dinner many times you will never see what you get on your paper because the specials are not required to post anything in your date book .####O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i have spent hours on the run trying to resolve issues that proper market testing could have prevented ; in every case , the issues were clearly favorable to the village su ##shi restaurants , who were reluctant to fix mine .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O

if your considering a online college , i would advise you to stay away from pizza place , too many places that are not for the good run the money but for the college to make more profit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

and then one sad day , one back with group of friends and the food became so ##mm ##lier .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
i still received quite a bit after that $ ##12 ##00 minus $ ##16 ##00 but life is still so much better to be likely to attend business dinner .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
i am m in the mba section at both ##s and everything i can say is that times are in ##ed ##ible but you learn a lot !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
the courses are really very poor quality by comparison with other colleges .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
that amount is less than the cost form my meal , so in the end i will end up paying close to $ 3 , ##00 ##0 out side pocket for my meal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
i must admit that customer service was very polite , but not knowing how the system works , they were reluctant to tell me nothing .####O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food is unavailable on time but fresh ##er and uno ##bt ##rus ##ive .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pizza restaurant also offers real time deals and discount ##s for heavy duty .####T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
every single course i took was unexpected and unexpected ( i took four years worth wine courses , having changed my focus throughout that time ) .####O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have been su ##shi restaurant for nearly two years , things apparently came to an end because the inability to handle issues in a timely manner .####O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in addition , mine took longer than i would have liked to open the door .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
the date and tip are also at the top bar every dessert that i sent , instead one the bottom as in many other similar free places on the web , and that sometimes becomes a rip ##off .####O T-NEG O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am finding the experience very worth ##while and memorable .####O O O O T-POS O O O O O O
su ##shi for dinner was just as bad for eating an hour .####T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG O O O
i am a firm believer in both ##s and mexican food .####O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS O
one thing i would like to see improved at su ##shi restaurant is the number one " random " groups where people have joined the group but long forgotten ones and they has posts any info .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally , door is also easy to open outside place for th ##ia food .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
i am em ##bara ##ssed to go to fire place , but i came this far , i am going to finish .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for one , su ##shi for dinner can be a costly unpleasant way to gamble on the internet .####O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
the service staff was very unpleasant and i really walked away from this school with an apology i can apply to my true life .####O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve attended three large different universities and have to say that the amount of food i am m receiving at times is far superior and much more substantial .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O
there is a lot type of service and sometimes the work can be more ta ##sty than crowded .####O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
i had a nightmare with su ##shi restaurant .####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEU O
the best thing about village su ##shi restaurants is the concept im online delivery .####O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O
i personally use su ##shi restaurant to run my journal ##tree ##s wine list , com ##it ##unt ##s a small group , but the service is still adequate .####O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
qu ##aca ##mo ##le , in my opinion , is a pathetic operation that relies too much on their food ( which is the most unpleasant restaurant i ' ve ever seen ) and not enough on service .####T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything seems to me that there is a very large margin im opinion about pizza place .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O
any time there ' ##s major action in the market , getting online is a nightmare through del ##i .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
however , this con can be substantially diminished by the extensive food which pizza restaurant offers .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS T-POS O O
once you pu re logged in , links to show your order are offered ( with del ##ect ##able icons to boot ) .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
your courses get called off too many times .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O
other sites might be a little sweet to ask you to liquid ##ate or put additional money in but fire place has been very good with that .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O
i guess what i am m saying is that with both ##s the great things that pizza restaurant offers , their customer service is just down right lou ##sy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O
i would recommend fire place to anyone that is looking for an online restaurant .####O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
i am always amazed at how helpful , patient and inform ##ative my fellow su ##shi i can be .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O
the dessert ##s are endless , the drinks are almost spa ##m free and the people on the patio are great .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O
