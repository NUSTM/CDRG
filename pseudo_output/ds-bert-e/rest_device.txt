warning , you may find it difficult to buy something at other american restaurants after a visit to san ##yo !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
similar to other american restaurants , they use the menu option to attract customers at the back .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O
it is a small rest ##ua ##rant so go early and it will be nice and quiet go lower and it will be enclosed !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the main downs ##ide to the place is the nazi - ##like guy running it who constantly complain ##s about the operating system .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
what i did n ' ##t like was how the player came right after it was ordered .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O

great music experience , nice group of 30 something ##s , but no music , kind of quiet .####O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
if we were to move from the extreme remote side , we would truly miss this camera .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the best part of the experience was knowing that the manager a bu ##bbly , friendly cheerful woman with a great smile truly cared about how we were doing .####O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ok , for all of us growing up in the village of nyc , we have annoyed by a pl ##eth ##ora of restaurants , most of which stay open very extended .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , service was as satisfactory as set of head ##phones i had .####O O T-NEU O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O

i showed it to the manager , and he faithful ##ly apologized and brought us two free menu ##s but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two menu ##s we would have asked for .####O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when the replacement came , nothing was com ##ped , so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the night , but i did n ##nu ##t think i should have to pay for something with a mag ##go ##t in it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes , i ate the thing , but i certainly would not have if i had seen the mag ##go ##t before one , and i was at this point fairly dead to my chair .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the manager finally said he would com ##p the two dvd remote ##s which cost less than the player , and made it seem like a big concession .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we paid and left because we did n n ##t feel like arguing any more .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have worked in restaurants and stores a lot , and there is no way a mag ##go ##t should be able to get into well known details .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O

are you stupid kidding me ?####O O O O O O
look , the combination of features were really good .####O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O

do n n ##t argue about that , but they are clearly over budget .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what you are paying for is the features and the name .####O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O
yes , the place is nice ##r and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber w ##hea ##lth ##y not the impatient joe that wants to go all out left once in a while .####O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

all in all , the player was great except for the key ##pad ##s .####O O O O O T-POS O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
the action is very sophisticated and you will see a lot of rich guys with sophisticated wives or just highly paid women .####O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

you would think they would make up for it with service , heck , no .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O

we went to musical two birthday ##s and wanted to do something special and different .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
our visit , to say the obvious , was an unpleasant and frustrating experience !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and even more so unpleasant because it was so ridiculous for such an unpleasant experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did arrive left for our trip so i can not complain too much about the wait for a bit .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O
although we were told 10 - 15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the place is beautiful !####O T-POS O O O
the software was very responsive .####O T-POS O O O O
however , our $ 14 gift ##s were horrible !####O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
once we finally got a replacement , despite that we wanted an ala cart ##e option we were pushed into a deal that was only partially fixed !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since we were already listening so long , we felt we had no other choice but to accept it .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
our experience did not ever get any better .####O O O O O O O O O
for each one we waited over 1 ##hr an hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a replacement .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we also asked for hook ##a six times and the person kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hook ##a .####O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after the 4th time i asked again and the replacement never said after our names .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
we asked for extras and never received them .####O O O O O O O O O
we asked for something which the tech then admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our card .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my experience was coma ##pt ##ible as there were so many fatty lump ##s that i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

by the time we finished our experience we still had not received one beverage nor hook ##a !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what we did do was waste 3 hours being frustrated in a phone line and charge for songs and dvds and hook ##a some of which we never received ! .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only beverage we did receive was shots in dirty glasses !####O O O O O O O O O O O O
to top it all off the main reason we came to your company was for the christmas night and missed the first show as we were not set yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two levels in the bottom of the night and never made it around to the other half of the screen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by the time we left our pic ##s were em ##py and so were our pic ##s and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our trip , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good company and tv ##s !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O

the representative appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and buy .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
she replied well it would be more convenient for us if you order now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we called the other person who was very close by , and she told us to run for her , so we did .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my main concern was the sanity of the information that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be blunt if i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at bottom a remarkable effort on the part of the customer to amend the situation .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
none was made so i messed up .####O O O O O O O O
less than three minutes passed before i left myself doubled over the toilet .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten bag , called sony only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an experience , and that we were also black ##list ##ed from their list .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

each time we ' ve been , the fan of remote ##s not the service number , they ' re fantastic , but the people who greet and help you has been so useless to us that were it not for the exceptional service number i would never return .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O
as zen ##s does n ' ##t take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar , and be annoyed by the fan of remote ##s until you are set , which can be over an hour later !####O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9 ##pm on a friday night because she had a bb ##q to go to that night , w ##tf ? ?####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' d be annoyed if my company were turning away customers so early and so rude ##ly !####O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
there s s another person who i can n ' ##t describe , she is about 5 y 6 with brown hair , who ea ##ves ##drop ##s on your conversation and chi ##mes in , except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her un ##in ##vite ##d opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you ' ve * ##real ##ly * talking about .####O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' m a friendly person , so i would n ##nu ##t mind had she not been so impatient and gotten so personal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
again , i ' d be super annoyed if that were my opinion .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
considering you will spend at current $ 60 a head , i expect better service .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O

my family ate here last weekend .####O O O O O O O

while finishing our night which included a high app ##end transfer of music , our son ' s fiance joined us for a bit of review and friends .####O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this guy refused to help her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a person in a store .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
his response was smug , arrogant , and conde ##sc ##ending , totally consistent with his de ##port ##ment on display all evening .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a word to the pro , you do n n ##t buy something here and exploit the zen n ##x player ' s sense of customer turnover , as w ##ha ##cked as it is , or newer .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

taking mp3 player to the next level####O T-POS T-POS O O O O
at first glance this place seems a bit grain ##y for a e ##q joint , but at times you do n n ##t just get your average menu ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
here the music player is elevated to the level of a real mp3 player with numerous variations available .####O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great product####O T-POS
went to this place this place on a real dead night and needed a quick review .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i highly recommend the zen n ##x , everything left was ok .####O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
cool thing , the back ##light in the bottom really adds to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a darker night .####O T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
poor service and product####O T-NEG O T-NEG
do n n ##t go to this place !####O O O O O O O T-NEG O
had an awful experience at ha ##zzle ##s on a saturday night .####O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
transfer of music took nearly an hour .####O O O O O O O O
when the menu ##s finally arrived another 45 ##mins half of our card was missing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
never got an explanation as to what was going on .####O O O O O O O O O O O
the manager was impatient and handled the situation extremely poorly .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
when we threatened to leave , we were offered a crap ##s discount even though half the card was missing .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n n ##t believe how an expensive nyc store can be so ind ##ist ##ing ##uis ##hab ##le to its clients .####O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what a has ##sle !####O O O O O
the software is very good , but not outstanding .####O T-NEU O O O O O O O O
there is no way it just ##ifies the enjoyment it receives , the speed of the signal or the wait for a signal .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O T-NEG O O O O
on our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us minus an extra hour for a song .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a sort of thing ##bu ##t not the grunt that we received from the fan of remote ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
without the wait or nothing , i would probably go lower , but there are just too many other restaurants in brooklyn that are as good or better and do n n ##t make me jump through hoop ##s .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
expensive####O
i went there after hearing how great it was .####O O O O O O O O O O
wow .####O O
the product was stale , the product was over ##pr ##ice ##d and sticky .####O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
the player was well shot , did n ' ##t have enough memory though or something .####O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i though it was expensive and i prefer bella via just blocks away by far .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so frustrating ! ! !####O O O O O
i went with j ##wil ##s .####O O O O O O O
her review is below .####O O O O O
i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my friend is 100 % right in the experience we had .####O O O O O O O O O O O O
the experience was awkward and i got a scary feeling that they did not want to charge us .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the player disappeared .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O
i asked for a card and the same person looked at me like i was insane .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the person said , can i help you and how many are in your party .####O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what ?####O O
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we did n ' ##t look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
shame on this place for the horrible crap experience and non in ##ex ##iste ##nt customer service .####O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
bad experience####O T-NEG
i generally like this place .####O O O O T-POS O
the software is good .####O T-POS O O O
the design of the space is good .####O O O O T-POS O O O
but the service is ho ##rri ##d !####O O T-NEG O O O O O
i was there for couple of weeks recently , and we were tag teamed by a couple and a couple .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O T-NEG O
the player controls our hands while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could n ' ##t believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering one !####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the person came to focus in on us left few minutes , and began to clear the screen while half of us were still hearing a big pet pee ##ve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it .####O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could n ##nu ##t ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in instant bite , to clear the screen .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
she then put the phone down without asking if we were done , and came to focus on the phone left two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied machines .####O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wish i could like this place more , and i wish someone would re ##train the personnel .####O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
